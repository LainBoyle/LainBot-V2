||pulsatilla||LOCKING the cabinet after.
||pulsatilla||`[2]` This is... the worst drink... ever. Yuumi thinks he did a good job! Look at that color change! mmMMmmMMmmMMMM MURK Y. 

He leaves.
||pulsatilla||Here...
||pulsatilla||"I know my age, I don't know my birthday. I pick a random day throughout the year and declare it as the day I get older. I don't celebrate, nor do I tell people. It is only a matter of when I feel like aging." Wow....
||.wozwald.||"Pshhh~ Are you saying you're older- I thought you didn't know."
||pulsatilla||"Good, you aren't older than me." Sip.
||.wozwald.||"Twenty-five. . . I think~! I stopped counting."
||pulsatilla||"..." The answer is sufficient enough, or, maybe Yuumi is too tired to try and dig deeper.

"...How old are you turning?"
||.wozwald.||"For some people. . That's all."

At least it wasn't a complete aversion to the question: No need to talk about an obvious answer, especially with regards that this is less for himself and more for people that Yuumi doesn't even know... It felt mocking to get him too indulged in this prospect.
||pulsatilla||"Had it not been...?"
||.wozwald.||"Ahahaha~!! You're just like me then , I'd have forgotten had it not been. . Mn~"

Pausing, his tone halted : Taking a quick swig, deciding to really let the silence speak for itself. "I would forget if I could. . No point in celebrating it for myself but for others."
||pulsatilla||"Never had the time, nor the care. It's one day out of the entire year, I never saw a point in claiming one for myself. I don't celebrate, don't have the money or friends to...  and eventually I forgot that 'birthdays' were a genuine thing." Little shrug.

"You're celebrating regardless, so congratulations."
||.wozwald.||"It's not for me. . But for the others that would want me to. . If you don't know yours, why not choose a birthday?"

Simple answer to that, snorting a little, shaking his head. "I don't worry about the spectacle of it, not in the slightest."
||pulsatilla||"Well, happy birthday to you." He grunts, taking another swallow of his drink. Guh...

"I've never celebrated mine, nor do I know when it is. So, I don't fully understand the sentiment with this... but- good on you for celebrating in your own peaceful way."
||.wozwald.||". . Hm ~ It's a small world here right now : Two are alive , but one's gone."

Taking a swig, following a deprecating chuckle. "Didn't think you'd show, but sitting here with anyone else would ruin the quietness. I don't often celebrate, y'know? I don't consider my birthday important : But if there's something to celebrate, I suppose it's the important people in your life."
||pulsatilla||"Do you mean those who have died, or those who are busy?" He takes a glass, bringing the rim to his lips. He stares past Natsume, off into space.
||.wozwald.||". . . It's a nice feeling to be in the realm of reminiscence."

Twisting his wrist in circles with glass in hand, the contents circulating the opaque container.. "There's two drinks : Both whisky , if you want . Just a celebration for friends who can't be here today."
||pulsatilla||He quietly steps over... pulling himself up to the stool to sit. "..."
||.wozwald.||He's quietly gesturing him to one of the bar stools he had set up : The music was still going.
||pulsatilla||In here... Staring at Natsume.
||.wozwald.||<:Natsume:1241457576768700456> Maybe it's time to get a move on. . But to be frank? (who is frank) He's still here.
||.wozwald.||_ _

Yet Natsume Soseki didn't care , it was his own little world right now , a callback to bygone eras.

    "Another year passes by. . . Thanks to Mister. Mirai, I didn't forget~"

Sliding the gratitude aside, taking back but a single swig. To have lied about such things before, just so people wouldn't seek him out in this current state.
[ <:hi_monochromeclock:1006615286658646127> ] Maybe some day.
There's no telling.

    Tick tock...
       Tick tock...

It's a `GOOD` day.

     "I raise this glass to you ~ My dear friends who are not here ; I raise it to you."

Holding it high , the man embraced such silence, no response was given and none was expected. This message was only for the ones above. Usually this would be at their often-sought out bar where the three as a found-family would act on celebration... `20` That was the legal age in Japan.. Though due to connections, being able to dwell in the bar at a lower age was fine as long as no alcohol was prescribed : It isn't a medicine he'd take so willingly in the first place. <:autumn_leaf12:1280362348539936878> 
Such a blessing. Always a blessing. 

To act without purpose in life : The human condition is but his own.

  <a:ConfettiParty:832705305774784512>   `DEFINE JOY.` <a:ConfettiParty:832705305774784512> 
' You know the answer : Something makes you happy. '
Sure enough , there's a definition, an attribute to his own character that lingers, alone, the masked individual sets down the three glasses ; bottle not so far, resting against the bar for a second before choosing to slide in a choice of french jazz... Debating between quiet piano music, where that instrument carried a... Solemn dwelling.
   To accompany the sweet dew.
   A honey mead even.
      ...
'People are my joy : They truly interest me , Mister. Moriyama...'  Pinching the memory for it is quick to drown within the sombre music , a small  and the bottle chimed open, resting its cap beside it, Natsume Soseki laid out the crystal whisky glasses to fill it so far its contents. Rummaging around for some ice, assumed the bar had some too , it was the last missing piece... Yet a necessary part to completing the picture.
> 
>

> It's nothing but chock full of solitary thoughts : Reminiscent of the red rouge that once painted the white-room, not full of any study, nor items at all : The blank beginnings are like any page.

> *To the man who you can only call a father, but that title doesn't fit : He is a doctor first and foremost, a man of intense compassion for the world - And his yielding resolve continues to be what drives you onward. For his sake. . . There will be an end.*
> 
>     Glass number `1` sat in the middle of three stools : Assumed that there were enough stools and if not, he'd just borrow one of the chairs. Close by : It had no ice-cubes in , whoever drank it preferred it for what it was... And sought not to change it for no demand.
> 
> Glass number `2.`
> *To his best friend. The one that even learning the truth of all surface intentions, continued to stand by, and be a voice... If not out of pity : But genuine care. He thinks that pursuing the impossible is but a waste, yet if anyone could do it... It would be the mind of a broken individual, one he knows that can't be fixed.*
> 
>    Such a glass , the glass `2` sat to the right. It had an ice-cube in, but was close to the brim of overflowing : For who had it enjoyed indulging more than he should in life and its trivialities It was all good fun for him, never a negative head on those shoulders...
> 
> The last glass... Number `3`
> *To the one he had lost - He remembers this exact combination : One resembling a frozen star- A bitter cold outlook on the world. The anger is the same you adopted, and since you've taken to this tradition, it was the one you would always order... When with them. You see it through such a lens, that maybe these memories are nothing but faded colours.*
> 
>    Two ice-cubes, with such little mixture in : It was a sad mans drink , but only topped once more, to watch the topaz poison run down the ice-cube... It still had a taste, nothing but a distinguishing... Reverberation. Your drink. You remember it well.
> 
>     . . . ||   ||
> 
> To a bitter tomorrow.
A hand shuffled, raising the glass, to an empty clink : It was impromptu - Much to the misty-fields that scatter unseen leaves, praying for nothing more than a quiet time here without interruptions. Not that... It's really guaranteed.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||> easy listening music, jazz and jazz. Very generic to American, Italian and French. They have some of beatlemania adjacent music too, the pop hits!
||.wozwald.||He's just gonna browse through records... Anything jazz related? Obviously just instrumental wise
||maamthatsafederaloffense||> Maybe not obvious, but apart of the furniture, a cabinet and sound bar a La mid century!

> you can insert a record here! It connects to the speaker system.
||.wozwald.||> <@&1213006530828566598> Is there a phonograph or a record player perhaps...? Just to play music on
||.wozwald.||Finally here... <:sigh:914542108839407667> Time to get to work.
||pulsatilla||After that is all said and done, Yuumi cleans up his mess and heads out.
||kyunu||Moving right along in search of good times and good news
||kyunu||`Fnaf 1 animatronic at door sound effect`

Hinoki spends a short time cleaning up in here, before picking up her wine bottles and moving right along... <:warmsmile:1132818725385539604>
||kyunu||She'll laugh at that, and then listen... 

`. . .`
||pulsatilla||"You simply missed an opportunity to ask." He does a little shrug.

"Which does remind me..." He leans forward. `"..."`
||kyunu||"You say that like I'd know my boss's drinking habits from a single work meeting. ~" Stare, smileee... giggle.
||pulsatilla||"Surprised you're asking me. Weren't you just with him?" Stare.
||kyunu||`Tolerance 7 &  87/100 ...` Her face is still red, but what's new? 

"Maybe instead of a brunch, we should just go out for drinks after all ~ Does the Chairman drink?" She'll look curiously at Yuumi.
||pulsatilla||"Team Kazuo has a reputation, we all are playing the part." He's not gonna lie about it.
||kyunu||Hinoki watches him go... the referral, and THEN the shade??? damn she's speechless. 

"Wow ~ Didn't think my reputation would be alcoholism but, here we are. Not that I'm upset..." She'll sigh, taking a long sip of her drink. "I've been here waaaaay too often ~"
||kyunu||THIS IS SO FUNNY
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just watches him go... Wowa...

He looks at Hinoki. "Looks like your run of drinking without odd looks is coming to an end." He sips his juice. Grown ass man.
||bellboy||THEYRE BOTH GERMS BRUH
||bellboy||THEYRE DRINKING OUT OF CUPS AND SITTING ON SEATS
||kyunu||HINOKI IS THE MESS RIGHT??
||bellboy||NO
||kyunu||IS THE BAR A MESS LOL
||kyunu||WHAT MESS???
||bellboy||HE AINT MEAN IT LIKE THAT BRUH
||kyunu||"thats crazy" she doesn't say that
||pulsatilla||THE SHADE...
||pulsatilla||ZAMN
||bellboy||*He nods.* " There's already mess. " *in response to hinoki. He leaves.*

<@131145091178954752>
||kyunu||"Alright ~" Acknowledging Yuumi with a nod, she'll pour herself a glass of wine, humming delightfully to herself. In a good mood with the wine in front of her... And, she'll take a sip. 

"We'll be sure to clean up if there is one, though ~" On the topic of messes...
<@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||"I'll do my best to not make a mess." Bars.

He takes the juice and sips it, then shaking his head to Hinoki. "I will pass for now."
||kyunu||LAUGHING SO HARD
||bellboy||*Kali grabs some juice and fruit out for yuumi before locking up.* " clea- " *no, nevermind.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||> NO
||pulsatilla||<@305913481113239552>
||pulsatilla||HE'S IN HERE?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||> hes busy
||kyunu||How funny itd be if Kazuo were here
||kyunu||Hinoki goes right for grabbing a bottle of red wine- actually, shell take two.

Thank you again ~ She sighs, grabbing herself a glass before looking over to Yuumi. Did you want some? <:HEHE:1091255991028416584> 

<@242165436731359232> <@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi will let Hinoki grab what she wants, he's not really going to drink.
||bellboy||<@131145091178954752> <@162025912227987457>
||bellboy||*Kali opens the gates.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo (8) makes a drink. It could be better, so he makes a few more. 

(21) pretty good

(25) *There we are.* He sets it aside. 

(20) one over there

(7)  he should quit while hes ahead. 

He drinks his failures and takes the others away
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo time
||bellboy||*Here. Kali kinda just absent mindedly makes martinis*

*(8) terrible*

*(12) another bad one.*

*(9) and somehow this one is worse.*

*Ugh.......Kali, this should be second nature. Whatever is on your mind isn't important. do it.*

*(24)*

*Out.*
||pulsatilla|| <a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177> 

"Alright..." He'll lead Kali out neow... WEEEE!!!
||bellboy||" ........sure. " *(22) Its just as amazing as the others.......kali is natsume's biggest hater.*
||pulsatilla||He's staring... then nods... "Are you going to make yourself one?"
||bellboy||" I see....." *A delicious, gorgeous, magnificent drink is made for callista too. (23)*
||pulsatilla||"Yeah." He nods, remembering Callista's party era.
||bellboy||" does she like alcohol ? "
||pulsatilla||WOW!!! Yuumi takes the drinks and the fruit bowl... Hell yeh... "Thank you... if you'd like to join us you can. I just need to clear a few things up with him..." Guh, stressed...

"Callista will also be there, hopefully."
||bellboy||*He makes yuumi a mocktail and it looks and tastes amazing. gorgeous. best of the best.....he did tricks to make that mocktail. (23) oh and a small bowl of fruit bc yuumi is fed like a rodent.*
||pulsatilla||
||bellboy||Mediocre presentation as well (10)
||bellboy||*Right so he makes the nastiest drink ever for Natsume.*
||bellboy||yeah and some juice....for mocktails....
||pulsatilla||"...I'll leave that up to you." Does the bar have any little fruits for the fruity drinks... Yuumi kind of just wants a cup of them to eat.
||bellboy||*you get nothing.*
||bellboy||" hmmm.......you want me to mix something or do you want a bottle ? "
||pulsatilla||"Something bitter, he said." `3`..... :(
||bellboy||" hm. what kind of alcohol does he want ? " *perception roll.*
||pulsatilla||"Not for me, for Natsume." He turns his head away...
||bellboy||" what about your meds ? " *squint.*
||pulsatilla||<@242165436731359232> <:angle:1296330924904157194>
||pulsatilla||Here, he's staring at Kali silently asking him to unlock the goods. Team Kazuo Alcoholic for the win....
||snombi||TIME
||snombi||OOP GO
||aias_||She's gonna stand up and sippi on some water
||aias_||"Baii Miraii~"
||aias_||Munch munch munch...
"I appreicate....you co*mmin*g down...Ms... Hag*es*awa*a*...~"
She dips her head as respectively as she can muster.

She takes this opportunity to kill off the rest of her Death in the Afternoon.

Hah.. Get it...

She also claps at Mirai's bar moves, as he's been keeping them on the downlow for a little while now.

Once again turning to Soraya...
"Are youwell? Wehabrnt really talked since.....*thebackrooms...*I ah..Sorayaa~ I wanteed to check upnonnyou~"

<@196879022909554689>
||snombi||She would've been impressed either way. She claps for their smooth moves! <a:happycatclapping:962103970376060958>
||snombi||She's glad to know she has options, at the very least. "Um.. f..for now, I'll just have.. water, thank you.. I might.. change my mind later though, I think.."
||snombi||After having a crunchy wonton, she wipes her mouth with her wrist before looking down at him. She knew that look and she can't help but smile a bit more as she leans down to peck him on the lips. She is very easily swayed, rest assured.

"Oh, ah.. a drink..? Hmmn.. Probably, ah.. just a.. water or something, really.."
||aias_||Okay hold on, pretend Baeyo is munching on some nachos while I find something to eat irl, she'll be passively chilling for a little bit
||snombi||However! She is also just as happy to be lifted off the ground, mainly because that means she's in Mirai's arms. Instinctively, she hugs them and smiles.

"I.. I'm happy to.. to see you both.." Once she lets go, she can't help but munch on one or two nachoes that she brought.. Holy moly, she dies.. Of good flavor. Like, you could probably see some color return to her face upon taking a bite. <@196879022909554689>
||snombi||`[4]` dumb fuck
||aias_||"Ms. Housegawa! Welcome..ha..imm *sooo~* glad to *se*e *you*...!"

She grins goofily and waves!
She's really trying to hold back staring at that 91 deliciousness poke nacho...
||snombi||She happily scurries over with a small skip in her step, putting the tray of beautiful nachos on the bar counter. They look amazing with spicy mayo drizzled on top, paired with pieces of avocado, jalapenos, green onions, and sprinkled with sesame seeds. 

"Hi.. Hello.." She looks happy to see the both of them.
||snombi||its okay
||snombi||i was craving poke and im doing this to myself
||aias_||Ambi you cant do this to me I haven't eaten in 11 hours
||snombi||Soraya enters, holding a nice big plate of yummy good stuff. The yummy good stuff in question was.. Poke wonton nachos with spicy ahi tuna. <:smeee:1269374718956408943>
||aias_||She does a lil pout with the most betrayed look on her face
||snombi||jumps here
||aias_||`Silly: 90`
"Um...eto..." She places her hands over her forehead. "Bleh~"

She gives a sheepish grin and reaches for her water....
||aias_||Here since he's in proximity this time...
||aias_||Unfortunately he tried and teased her and this is the end result. But also....The intoxication...

"Ms. Hase*swag*aaa~? Has...Hasegawa..." She frowns to herself. No.... Haseswaga has to be right....Right? "Hiyaa~ Sooo I'm with Mr. Agaki...andwere...havinasuorr chillhangiut inn the row-dy-room."

She emphasizes each syllable.

"...And Miraii aha...Said some funnny things...hehe..! But he's just *soooo~* hungrry and so I was hopingg one of our good frirned...--*frienss*...Could run by the foodcourtand hang out with us!"

She smiles and holds out the comm device to her Drink Master.
"Saay hi Mirai!" :D
||aias_||"||Goooldfish||"

*||The snack that smiles back...||*

"You're hungrry? Doo youwanna...*hic*... orderr in...maaybe~?"

She takes out her comm and types something before putting it on the walkie talkie setting and punching in a random frequency. She nestles it between her shoulder and ear.

"Hello*o*o~?"
||aias_||`"..."`
She holds her glass up.
||aias_||Phew on my break
Baeyo is gonna look at her comm...

`...`
`"..."`

Unfortunately her guess doesn't come up in deference to um....*that*
||aias_||"Okaay... Nexxt rouund...." Thinking... "Okay...||lucky||..!"
||aias_||"||Beachhat...||" Similarly stumped...
||aias_||She blinks rapidly before pressing her finger to her upper lip as she thinks... "Toughh..."
||aias_||She dips her head in understanding.

"Lesssgo with... ||ocean||!"
||aias_||She taps a quick message on her com with very unsteady hands before returning her gaze to Mirai
||aias_||"...Whyy did you leave?"
Some specific stuff she's asking about but a bit too drunk to make it clear...

*If... I killl off... Thiiis waterrr....he'll make meaneeew drink...!*

She pulls the glass back with her... Taking some small sips to appease her DM. (Her Drink Master.)

"Well...I kno*w*w you wa*ntedd*to ask meab*o*ut Ae-ra...I dint...*don't* want to split this up...so*mayb*ee.. I'll ex*pla*inn it af*te*rr the game...~!

"I...stopped afterAe-ra arrived...Aha...ha....*ha*...." She trails off.
||aias_||"Iss*dt*hats soo..~?" Tilting her head curiously. "Miraaiii.... How long were.. youin.. Japann?"

She drags her finger along the rim of her glass as she glances down momentarily.

"D...did you like.. the boso--" That's not right." The *blossom*...?"
||aias_||10 DMS...
||aias_||She nods.
"Mhmm! It'sa couople....monthss of no responasbility~!" She giggles to herself.

`Perception`
||aias_||okay last response fr now I eepy
||aias_||She lets out a somewhat goofy grin in return.
"Thaanks hehe~"

"I'd t*hi*nkthat...it woould be ||sumerrr vacation||!"
||aias_||"*Ros*"

Her eyes seem to go out of focus somewhat...just staring out in front of her. Composed enough that *the gold fails to tarnish* but...

`"..." ` 
"...I appreciate it, nonetheless...."

Now putting all her focus back to the game, she runs her fingers through her hair in an attempt to reground her on what truly matters. *Getting silly.*
"Alright... how about ||freedom||!"
||aias_||Baeyo nods aggressively!
"Ooh...aha....Clementine soouunds cute~!" She giggles to herself, maybe a bit too much... "I alwaaays wished..I could ha..ve own....*hic*..... a pet....maybe....of my own....maybe a cat..."

"I've...even......had a dreamm...name forit...~"

`"..."` - `Composure Nat23`
"Aha...ha...."

"Alriiight~" She gestures to Mirai as she speaks in a sing songy voice. "Would....you liikee.. to starrt the next woords....?

||aias_||`Perception`
its gonna be a really weird one...
||aias_||"Pfft! Hah...aaha...!" Baeyo follows suit giggling to herself...crazy how they totally stumbled into that one. As the laughter dies down she finally returns her gaze to the drinks in front of them.

"You know the ruules~ Time to take a drink~" She smiles giddily as she takes a large sip from her drink...
`Tolerance: 6` - That slowing receding blush returns in full force and then some...

"...say...M..Mirai....hic....doo youu associate youurself w...with bun...with rab...bits.....or do otherr peop..ple.....associate you with...them too~.....?"
||aias_||Blink blonk.
No hesitation.

"||You.||"
||aias_||Im gonna need to roll for this
||aias_||OH MY GOD
||aias_||She takes note of them...more topics pinned...

Baeyo takes the drink and stares at it longingly before putting it to the side...
No jumping the gun here...

"Pfft...sure...how about ||security||?"
||aias_||She really doesn't want to spent too much time! She might randomly flip to some pages further in the notebook... before ending her little exploration into Mirai art afterwards.
Her eyes are focused on the drink though. 

//also gonna be away for a bit! grabbing dinner!
||kyunu||*Imagine Hinoki flashed a smile to Baeyo before leaving!!! Heard!!*
||aias_||"So soon? Um...Ms. Mu... I do want to chat with you again after things are all said and done..." She smiles and offers her another wave. "You know..."

"I'll see ya laterr~"
||kyunu||*Waddle away with a smile and a wave!!*
||kyunu||<@248897197935034378> *Hinoki keeps her eyes fixed on Baeyo for a moment, taking a slow sip of her drink with a smile.* Weve been out playing dress up and taking photos. ~ As much as Id love to stay and chit-chat I dont want to overstay my welcome. Ill leave you both to it so you can continue your previous conversation. ~ 

<@196879022909554689> *Her eyes lift up to Mirai again, and she speaks in Japanese.* [ Let me know if you need me. ~ ]

<@161652713359147009> *Shell glance back over to Tiff, leaning away from the bar counter with the intent to follow her but shell glance back first to the two in front of her curiously before she goes, waiting to hear from them.*
||aias_||please allow Mirai to go crazy with it Tatsu im begging
||aias_||"Goodbye~... Thank you for taking care of things Ms. Singh..!" Bae waves as she exits the room..
||aias_||Baeyo doesn't think anythings wrong
||aias_||*Yes... this makes sense for Ms. Singher...*

||kyunu||11
||aias_||"I willl~" Humming contently she nibbles at the cookie. She at least maintains enough dignity to finish chewing before speaking again. Big day for drinking water. "Mm~ This is good... I'm glad..you two found smthing nice-- the sweet thingsare always the most wild....quality wise..."
`Tolerance: 62 - Girl is getting a smidge too distracted to keep herself drunk. She's off her game. Still tipsy though.`

She downs the water quickly enough, as the rate of her sips increased after Mirai gave her the ultimatum for more drinks to follow, taking more bites of the cookie inbetween aforementioned sips.
"It's been funn aha... Mr. Agaki keeps distratting me with topics I want to dig deeper into..."

She's all smiles! Having the time of her life fr...
"What have you and Ms. Sing been up to? You seem to have been up to some fun stuff youselves~"

She's doing grabby hands at Mirai again...
-# "Can you get me something strong this time?"

<@161652713359147009> <@196879022909554689>
||kyunu||`Okay... ! ~ I can wait, though - I'll let you know if it comes up again.` *She'll respond quickly to Mirai, taking her drink with a smile.* "Thank you ~"

I understand. ~ Thank you, Mirai. I hope you both are having fun.` *She'll let that be the last thing she says in Japanese, for now, before turning her attention to Baeyo.*

<@248897197935034378>  "Make sure you finish drinking that water with those cookies. ~" *The sugar might not be a great add, though... She smiles warmly at her, leaning against the counter as she waits for her drink.* "Havin' fun?" :] *Repeated in English for Baeyo...*

||aias_||`Cha: 8` Baeyo looks incredibly jealous that she can't speak japanese
Similarly to how she was looking at Mirai that one time during Aggravation, she's once again looking up at them like
||aias_||damn
||kyunu||18
||aias_||She takes a cookie as she kills off the water, dipping her head politely at Tiff.
"Thank you very much Ms. Sin...~" She pauses, realizing what that sounds like. "...gh"

Her eyes flick between Hinoki and Mirai and....
`Perception.`
||kyunu||nat 1 (5) she spots a rainbow /jk
||kyunu||*Erm... After looking at Tiff, Hinoki curiously looks down at the counter / book... What's there...* <@196879022909554689>
||aias_||She's looking at Mirai while she's drinking her water like this

*Hinoki offers Baeyo a wave, as well as Mirai, giggling at Baeyo's demeanor with a bright grin... letting Mirai's slip through.* "I'd love a drink, if you don't mind - could you make something sweet for me? Thank you ~" *She steps over to Mirai and Baeyo with Tiff, and she'll...*

*She's going to say something in Japanese just for Mirai.* `"Are you doing alright? She's not giving you a hard time, is she?" It's in a playful tone.`
||aias_||nat 1 (4) baeyo heads stay winning
||aias_||"Hm?" Baeyo turns her gaze to view the new visitors. "Helllloooo~ Ms. Moo~ Hiya Ms. Sinngg~!"
She waves and smiles warmly at the two of them.

"Aha...I'd looove cookies tha--" She pauses and stares at Mirai for a split second, raising a careful eyebrow at him but not pushing the unspoken topic further. "I'd love some...thankss you both..!"
<@161652713359147009> <@131145091178954752> 

She kinda pouts a little bit, glancing at Mirai.
-# "I want another drink too..."

As if she wasn't the one instigating a billion tangents.
||aias_||Nat 23
||kyunu||
||kyunu||15
||kyunu||*Hinoki smiles as she looks inward.* "Hiiyyaaaaaa ~"
||aias_||She had intended the question about references to focus on the *design* of the zombies rather than the medical angle...that said....
!!!

"Yakuza?" She exhales deeply out of her nose, in a defeated, *almost exhaustive* gesture, though judging by the smile on her face it's not seemingly a bad thing persay. "...remidn...*remi*--...remind me to ask about that later. I have...sooo~ many questions...aha.."

She *cannot* append to the amount of concurrent conversations within this talk alone.... she'll explode....

"That makesense though..." Nodding. 

<@196879022909554689> Have the 10% of pages on each side all been those medical records/zombie drawings or is there anything notable on any of the pages she missed.
||aias_||15
||aias_||`Cha: 11` - While her intent remains primarily focused on the zombies, it's clear that her eyes drift towards Mirai's bites as she's asking about references, seemingly having made the link between the artwork and his own scars.

She looks more enamored by everything than offput....
||aias_||Her eyes scour the pages with great interest. The medical notes especially seem to draw her in initially, though it extends generally to the drawings as well. "Oh! Interesting... Might I..aha...um..may I ask what kind of stuff you use for refrences? ..Do you base it off a...particular intereretation of a zombie's.. ap..--appearance or do you have a concept projetced off of..how the body *should* react?"

`Perception.`
||aias_||Hmm
Hard to say without also getting a feel for how many pages there are in total
While she is interested she also wants to get to the game again...
So from the page she's on, maybe she'll check out 10% of the pages in this section prior to William Afton and 10% after these Afron renditions
||aias_||Dirty 20
||aias_||How many are there?
||aias_||"Do you thinkitll take long?" Tilting her head. "I think a quick..look should.. be fine...hehe~"

"I want to play with you a bit longer... so I'll try not to hold us up"
||aias_||Also is he drinking water or still sipping on the drink he had left?
||aias_||im so sorry Mirai when she's like this she's like a dog being shown a new sqeaky toy every couple seconds
||aias_||Her fingers hover over the page, close enough to help draw her focus to the details but far enough away as to not smudge anything. "I see..! You did a great job though...very true to life..." She'll pinch the next page between her thumb and index finger and look to Mirai with puppy dog eyes as if asking permission with her gaze alone.

"May I...?"
||aias_||"Woah..~" <:xaviergasp:1214852666040127489>  "I like your art! Aha...isn't Afton purlple though? I thght he was called the prul...*the purple guy*."
Not quite realizing it was a stylistic choice....
She looks fairly engaged with it all...it doesn't stop her from sending another comm message and sliding it back in her pocket though.
||aias_||  

"Nope~!" She's doing grabby hands. "I'm nt reallty offput by much anymore...Can I see?" [please](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1169841201332097085.webp?size=48&quality=lossless&name=please) 
I'd have her verbalize the emoji, but that's not her bit unfortunately...
||aias_||"W-William Afton?! Hee's that guy from Feddy Five Night, right?" 
She goes to tap something on her comm before quickly refocusing on Mirai.
||aias_||Baeyo furrows her brows...tricky..."Ahm...alright...3....2.....1.....||Terminator||!"
She bats her eyelashes at Mirai like she's manifesting him to have thought up the same thing.
||aias_||"Fair enugh..." She rests her cheek over a closed fist, and while there's some faint disappointment etched across her face, it's quickly overshadowed at a competitive excitement over the game.

"How about... ||electronic||"
||aias_||`"..."`

She takes a light sip of the water provided to her, more so to wash down the sweet aftertaste of her drink than anything else.

She nods at Mirai's response, smiling as she gazes at him.
"...I only did this because you didn't have the ansner... yourself. What *c...crosses the line for you*... It's alll I was trying to figure out...~"
She smiles a bit goofily as her head sways side to side. "I'll keep things clearer moving forward~"

She still has *some thoughts* but they go unsaid for now.

"But... For a game, I have an incrediblly simple proposition. It's easy-- each or us on a count of three...hehe... throw out a word. In the fol...following.." She frowns at her own hesitation before lightening up. "--*three* seconds we throw out a word that links or intersects the prior two..."

"So if we threw out *children* and *tranansportation*, and we both threw out the word *school bus* then we'd take a drink. Otherwise we keep going until we get it right!"
She claps her hands together excitedly.

`Baeyo's super simple drinking game with no ulterior motives!

In practice once they try to guess the interlocking word, we'll both spoiler our guess until the other has posted it and initiate drinking should they reach a match. Proposed words should also be spoiler tagged as to not influence one another.`

"If it's alright with you we can try this for a few rounds...And I'll let you begin questioning me laterrr~"
||aias_||`Empathy: Nat 20`
`???: 57/100`
`Tolerance: 13/100 - [That drink definitely hit her where it hurts. She's not as drunk as she can be by any means. She can go much...much...lower....]`
`And many other things...`

Baeyo sits still, her golden gaze finding its home atop the matte counter top as she waits for Mirai to return. She sips at the Peach Bellini steadily, though before she realizes it, all that's left of her beverage is a small colorful pool of liquid at the bottom of her glass. Stifling a groan, she begins humming a melody to herself, but before she can get too far in it, her conversation partner returns almost as soon as he left.

Her brows furrow as she glances over his updated appearance, noting the old scars and cuts sewn into his flesh. Unfortunately something she feared would happen a month ago seems increasingly likely to come to fruition.  

"H-hey... um... Mr. Akagi?" Her eyes flick downward before looking at him. "Before we continue...and definitely before talking...about *her*" Her voice trails off somewhat, though with the clear implication that something needs to be said first.

...Juust by glancing at your expression, you...must have picked up on *it* by now. I'm...*sorry.*" She dips her head slightly. "It's...*important to...me* to get a good grasp of the character of peo...--of those I talk to. And you're so very interesting, Mr. Akagi...aha...I couldn't helput try a bit harder for you."

"I just know tha...*ahem*...*I know* that approaching this on my own terms wouldn't go anywhere. There's...nothig wrong with how you've chosen to live your life. Nodding my head at everything wouldn't go anywhere--I wanted to present some arguments....that could *dig deeper* than I can.. is all."

"If you wanna to revisit those topics wecan...stuff just became *too familiar*...for me..."

"...And regarding `"..."`"

"....I felt badabout killing the mood sso I had a fun, simple game. I can make an info game if you'd like Mirai~"
||aias_||7 ;-;
||aias_||She kind of looks torn up about something, her eyes not quite in focus.

"Hm? Oh... Of course Mr. Akagi~" Small smile. "Go ahead, I won't be going anywhere."
||aias_||9 (thank god)
DMS
||aias_||"..."

An eyebrow twitches and Baeyo wordlessly kills off the rest of her drink. `Tolerance: 31/100` - Her cheeks are becoming a bit rosier... closer on the road to tipsytown if not there already.

She just silently listens to Mirai's recount of their mother's circumstances, the responsibilities--*all of it*. Not one detail goes unacknowledged, and no point goes unconsidered. Her smile thins, but the lessened visual expression is made up in full with the movement of her *eyes.* Shifting and shining brightly against the ambient lighting of the rowdy room, they seek to peel Mirai apart. To the deeper underlying questions and the *inner truths*.

She continues staring until her attention is drawn to the sound of Mirai's glass slamming against the table. And continuing to listen in, her eyelids droop somewhat as her eyes flick back to the corners of her eye. She does clap at Mirai's performance! That said some thoughts linger elsewhere.

`...Complicated? No, the answer has been nothing but simple.`

"...So that's how it is, hm? *Interesting.*"

An unusually short reply. *Curt and useless.* She pauses, as she runs her finger along the rim of her now depleted glass, before looking ahead towards Mirai once more.

"For what it's worth...that answer *makes sense.*"

"I think I'm satisfied traversing this line of questioning. ...If you want to ask me anything I'll give you the chance, otherwise I'll try and start a game."

"Though before that, would you be willing to top me up? And...`"..."`"

`Perception.`
||aias_||man...
I was just talking about how Baeyo pops off for the most pointless things... girl save that for the backrooms...
||aias_||`Cha: Nat 23`  She looks calm, collected, and at times amused but beyond that no change....
||aias_||
||aias_||Blink blonk.
"*Special tasks*?" She raises an eyebrow. "*My, my*...What does he have you do?"

Giving that air to breath she nods at the rest of his explanation, her eyes glimmering as she stares at him.
"You did tell me about the relationship you share with your mother last we held down a conversation together. And of the bunker and a bit of her reasoning and her circumstances. But yes, this is a good place to start. In spite of the torture and the training you told me that you still loved her immensely."

"Why did you forgive her? What exactly did you do to hold her responsible for her actions?" She chuckles to herself slightly, though it's more inward facing than anything else related to what Mirai said to her. "I hope this question hasn't gotten too old by now. I'd imagine you've heard it more than a few times by now, no?"

"...And I recognize what you're saying about responsibility and wanting to see people improve...." She reaches for The Zombie and takes another sip. `Tolerance: 86/100` - She doesn't seem like she's gotten any tipsier... "But from my perspective... well I guess the better question would be to ask what holding someone accountable means to you. I brought to you an example of a selfish and unjustifiable murder and you still tried to derive nuance from an inherently unnuanced prompt. And in response to the prospect of your loved ones dying to another, the words you simply described feeling would be 'not happy'. I don't expect you to feel all that emotional over hypotheticals. That said with responses like that, I'm sure you could imagine why I'm asking."

"Perhaps do you find that your emotional response runs secondary to the logical one?"

`Perception...`
||aias_||`Cha: 19`
Despite the heavy topic she seems to appreciate the conversation! She's having fun. 
It seems like she's ruminating on a lot of what Mirai's been saying, but what exactly those thoughts could be are obscured by her friendly smile and composed demeanor.

Nothing's ready to slip through the cracks just yet....
||aias_||`Perception.`
||aias_||Her eyes follow Mirai's hands as he works, though she doesn't seem to mind the mess of the drink. Unfortunately she hasn't seen Mirai at their best so she didn't really have any expectations coming in.

"Oh, the chairman's birthday?" She nods her head. "I'm well aware of it. *Halloween seems fitting for him*, I think." She notes the other things...

She chuckles a bit, flicking her gaze between Mirai and his notebook as she lets out a small giggle. "You *do* preform quite well in the games, Mr. Akagi. May I ask your secret~? Your luck in Aggravation has been *extraordinary*. I think the only thing in that game as impressive as your luck has been Ms. Koyama's ability to consistently roll 1s the turn after being knocked to start." She teases, perhaps to lighten the mood somewhat in a topically depressing subject, or perhaps she just can't help it.

"I think it's nice to have a wholistic view of people and their circumstances. Though, focusing *too* much on circumstance can lead to responsibility getting kicked down the road. Unfortunately, I think that people underestimate how much agency they really have control over. Even in the bleakest nights..." She chooses to pick up her Zombie drink and takes a sip. `Tolerance: 38/100` - Not drunk by any means though it evidently is putting her on the road to being tipsy. 

"...I do have more thoughts on the matter, but before I continue barking up that tree, I just would like to ask you straight up. Would you feel comfortable explaining your history and background to me a bit more? If not, that's fine, I may drop it or poke around when we get to the *game* aspect of our drinking game. I'm realizing that the approach I was using may not be effective. It seems that circumstance has a larger part to play for your judgements, Mr. Akagi~. So perhaps we'll pivot more to *thought experiments*. Alternatively we could work through hypotheticals related to your own experience, since you'll grasp the context better than I ever will."
||aias_||*Perhaps it's about time to pivot...*

Her eyes break contact with Mirai's and flick towards her own cup.
"...I'd appreciate something *stronger*, thank you. I'll leave it to you as my dm. (Drink Master)"
<@196879022909554689>
||aias_||"Well you can't blame a girl for trying~"
She shrugs as she briefly shuts her eyes. She sighs, letting out a one of those comical poofs of air out of her mouth. Her playful attitude seems preserved for this comment alone, something about her seems to take the rest of what she had to say more seriously.


"Though I'm quite aware that my approach in asking certain types of questions may make some people uncomfortable. With the chairman, I guess it's a bit more personal? Though it doesn't really have to do with him as a person, persay."

That's unhelpful.

"I'll see if he'll be willing to entertain small talk with me again. Just considering how things have been going lately, he *might* be more receptive next time."

The next bit of his reply is met with a nod, though isn't followed up with a response quite yet. There's quite a bit of her inner thoughts that she intends to review later...

"You seem to be quite flexible in your thinking, Mr. Akagi. Which is respectable personally. I myself try to avoid dealing in absolutes if I can avoid it, though even I have my own boundaries."

"For example, those who have inflicted harm to my family and loved ones, and those who would have them hypothetically killed are where the line *starts* for me. There couldn't ever be a justification good enough for their deaths and I simply love them too much to ever let it go even if the reasoning was sound."

She smiles at the acknowledgement to keep things between them, though it ebbs at the whispered reply. She stares at his eyes.

"...I can tell what you're thinking, Mr. Akagi. About that *specific thing* in the scenario. Please trust me when I say to you that it's old and *entirely unrelated* to what you're imagining. It *did* make it worse though, so I'm still investigating that. I apologize for bringing it up however, it really wasn't integral to the purpose of the story."
||aias_||Her eyes flick down to her comm as she types something before looking back at Mirai, smiling gently.
||aias_||Baeyo swiftly returns to her prior position, once again testing her chin between her hands, smiling gently.

She listens attentively to Mirai's explanation, keeping her gaze steady as she reads every bit of his body language as he responds, every little change in his expression. While not exactly the most hard hitting of questions and explanations *to a point*, this is largely just how she acts. 

Though the topic of murder does catch her interest, with her eyes *boring* into her conversation partner.

"Learned certain things? Would it be too much to inquire as to what that might be?" Her brow furrows somewhat as she makes a waving gesture with her right hand. "I'd like to talk to Mr. Nishiji myself but unfortunately he's been quite... How should I put it... *Evasive* when I try to pull him aside for chats."

As the next drink begins to get poured her smile returns to her face. "Hmm... A pretty well considered response, Mr. Akagi. So for you, does the potential to change for the better in the future mean you can look past the actions in the here and now?" She pauses. No perhaps that's not it. Maybe... "Or could it be that murder doesn't *cross that line* for you? What does it take for something to be absolutely unforgivable in your eyes?"

"Oh and before I forget, let me describe those scenarios. If it's all the same to you, I'd like to keep some of these between us until something changes..."

She speaks more softly, quickly becoming something akin to a whisper...

`...`

"I'll try and be as open as I can be~"
She hums to herself contently.
||aias_||She takes another sip of her drink as she silently observes Mirai. Noting the comment about resolving things between Valmont and Yuumi in particular. She never quite learned how that issue got resolved.

"It's interesting that you point out Mercedes *specifically* as someone you wouldn't help. *Not that I think you're wrong for that perspective or anything.* Would you fight for the Chairman then?"

She scrunches up her face. Tragically another great question gets left to the post aggravation drinking games...

"--And on another note. Is there someone you could always bat for? Even if they're in the wrong?"

She tilts her head inquisitively as her smile purses up a bit. "For example... You listed it out earlier as a horrible weight but...

"*Could you forgive even murder?*"

"If it was selfish and unjustifiable. Is there anyone you could imagine still standing behind in spite of it?"

Her eyes widen as she focuses that stare of hers on Mirai. With no red veil to obscure them, those pinpoint pupils, silhouetted against a *sea of gold*, bore into him.

Her gaze gets interrupted as she suddenly blinks and chuckles lightly. Maybe not the right time for such a thing but she holds herself to certain standards. And well. She's her. 

"Ah...And where are my manners, pelting you will all these questions back to back? I can offer you some more *direct* examples of certain points of conflict if you'll allow me to pick your brain over it.
||aias_||Oh thank god
I originally set it to ten and then reduced it lol
||aias_||Baeyo yap moment.

"Hm. I guess it requires some elaboration as it touches on a few things."

"As a passive observer, my impression of your relationships with the other interns has almost across the board been incredibly positive. I don't recall ever speaking to anyone that hates you by any means or viewed you in a particularly negative light, nor do the staff seem to *particularly* dislike you either. You seem to be on good terms with everyone, Mr. Akagi.

"It'd be presumptuous on my part to assume these extend into mutual friendships, though I can only guess at who you truly care about. And I'm aware that you have issues with those who go out of their way to weaponize your traumas but beyond that I'm not too sure about who you dislike either."

She reaches for the drink that Mirai had crafted for her as she slides it closer to her and offers him a thankful gesture. She takes a sip before continuing.

"So eventually I got to thinking. What kind of people do you like? What kind of people will you fight for? What would it take for you to fight a friend?"

That's 3 questions girl...


She's not trying to obscure her thoughts so I'm setting an 8 DC general `Perception`.
||aias_||"Ah... "

`Certain passing thoughts...`

"I understand. Any potential discussion on the topic would have focused on *behavior* rather than *circumstance*. He's been fairly direct in expressing his destain for us. Which really isn't the problem, but moreso how it manifests...."

She trails off a bit, as her eyes drift up towards the ceiling as if to recall something *specific*.

"--But to your point, I'll try to avoid bringing that incident up if I can avoid it. I personally don't really want to make things difficult for you in that way."

Her eyes draw downward, once again staring at Mirai, as hers become half lidded. She appears to be ruminating on a thought.

"...Mr. Akagi, might I ask you a somewhat personal question? It's nothing cutting too deep, though a part of me wishes I could have saved it for the game."
||aias_||"Ah... Well I'm glad that got resolved! Its great that you two cleared things up." She smiles warmly as she watches Mirai prepare the drink.

Though that content smile soon turns to a look of curiosity. "So was it Mr. Akiara who claimed that we were wanting to have you fight?" She sighs and presses her fingers to her nose bridge. "...If so I should probably talk with him. Tensions are already high between him and the rest of Team Kazuo. The last thing we need is another incident..."
||aias_||"I'm fine chatting for now though, if it's all the same to you."
||aias_||"Hmm... *Surprise me.*" She cracks a smile. "Something light though. This is an *intermission*, after all I'll wait till after we finish this wave of Aggravation before I start playing drinking games."

"I'd hate to get interrupted mid game, personally."

She sighs and shifts her eyes up to look at him directly.

"Might I ask what happened? With Ms. Xu I mean. I know *something* happened, though the details are beyond me." She pauses, squinting somewhat. "...And if it's not your place to say, that's alright. I can ask her myself the next time we meet."
||aias_||I'll be here for a liiiittle

She sits by the minibar as she rests her chin upon her hands, nestled comfortably between bent fingers.

She smiles warmly and addresses Mirai from the other side of the bar.

"Hello Mr. Akagi~. I'm sorry it took so long for us to finally get a chance to speak like this." Her eyes follow the alcohol as they proceed to set up the Team Kazuo Trap before returning to linger on Mirai."Are you doing well?"

(I'm sorry the bus is bumpy lol)

||kyunu||"Why were you doxxed?~ I'm surprised that that happened to you." *Leaving the whole, because you were in a bunker and all part out incase they opted to still have more outside access...* 

"`. . .` " *Hinoki exhales softly, looking down at her water and choosing to drink a bit more to stay on pace- so many fluids.* "That said, if you have any questions, feel free to shoot."
||kyunu||*Drinking some more water... Phew, she's back to just being a little tipsy - quick at that, too. Dirty 21 Tolerance. Her face is still red, but she'll be able to manage conversation a bit better!*

"Aaaah. ~ I went ahead and said all that too... The security in that domain should be secure, we spent a lot of time on that part... I'll have to ask more in another question." *Giggling a bit at that, her eyes glance over to the whiskey, and she pulls it over in front of her, goofy smile on her face.* 

*Oh, that question.* "`. . .` ~ Okay, time for my question back : Is doxxing in particular something you're worried about - the location tracking and all. ~"
||kyunu||*Wow! She must REALLY like video games.*
||kyunu||"Psh -- Safety protocols? Altair+ was very carefully engineered in that domain, as matter of fact. ~" *Sorry Mirai- she's drunk.

The medical *alerts* and console safety *protocols* ensure that users are ***healthy*** through the game...." *She sucks in a breath, exhaling deeply as she rambles.* "On average, most players disconnect within 3-4 hours for a break, and surveys for those who are disconnected at the 8 hour point trend towards positive reviews..."   

"Guh..." *She reaches for the water first, and drinks quite a bit of it, and she has a >:] face at Mirai.* "That - will be next question. What do you mean by safety protocols? Explain, in detail." *More of a demand than a question... She doesn't seem upset - Hinoki looks entirely serious.*

*It takes her a second to process the next question...* 

"Ummm... Hmmmmm... ~" *Silly smile on her face as her eyes wander. Another sip of her water.* "I... really like watching anime. I'll binge watch during work. ~ Other hobbies... video games?

"Aw. That's not fair. ~ `. . .` But, if you're curious about anything else, you'll have to use another *question.* ~" *She says that last bit in a sing songy tune, humming through it.* "I think I'll need to drink, not because it's a lie, but because I'll need it for the other questions... ~" *Laughing to herself, she'll down the rest of her drink - Tolerance : 5... &... 2/100...*

"Hhhh." *She sucks in a breath, and she's definitely no longer keeping up whatsoever. Hinoki was doing pretty good, but... she's definitely VERY drunk now. The drink just slammed her LMAO.* "... Could I... Get some water? ~ An old fashioned on the siiide...."
||kyunu||"Ah, right, another question. ~ " *For a moment, she opens her mouth, but... ultimately decides against leaning into all of the zombie talk again. They look pretty paranoid already.* "You mentioned you might've played in Altair+ when it launched. What did you think of it? ~" *... An extremely tame question.* 

"Well, I won't mind questions about my interests if you *really* want to know. ~" *She takes a sip of her drink... but the previous question about TOWD near instantly brought her back a bit. Tolerance : Nat 22. Her cheeks are still red but she's all there!* "This time, I won't lie. ~"
||kyunu||AWDLKJJKWLDAKWADAWD
||kyunu||I wouldnt say its either of those, really. ~ More so to keep things interesting rather than having to do anything with myself. *A quick response to their question first, letting them mull over the question she prompted.*

I really do quite like Telltale games. ~ The Walking Dead is a good one, but I do prefer the Wolf Among Us. The second game to The Walking Dead, I haven't played... If I could make a guess, Id wager you saved her because she had the gun on her - higher survivability, she could take out more zombies A bit more lethal, which is what they needed at that moment. *She taps her cup.* In that moment, I chose Carly too. ~ 

Im glad you took a drink though - silence is the best response. ~ That being said, its something we may choose while were here. It doesnt make either response correct, because there will never be a *right* answer.
||kyunu||Dirty 21 perception
||kyunu||( Im going out for a few hours but Ill respond when Im back!!! 
||kyunu||*She looks to the drink, cupping it with one hand as she idly taps the glass on it.* 

I know. ~ Regardless, my own hobbies, likes, dislikes, interests - the topic of myself is an uninteresting one. *Not necessarily retorting their point, she exhales softly. The why is left unsaid, still.* 

Hm. ~ Thats not bad at all. ~ *Is all shell respond with to their answer.* 

*Though, their next question has her laugh softly, smile on her face as she chuckles openly.* I have on a few occasions. *No explanation.* 

I like to guess around and see what sticks - that or more simple open-ended questions, as youve seen already. Lets see *Pausing to think* You have the choice between saving the love of your life and your best friend. You can only save one. Which one do you choose to save, and why?
||kyunu||*Hinoki hums as she watches them attempt to make a new drink instantly after, eyebrow raised a bit at his tolerance. Slowly, but surely theyre bound to get a LITTLE drunk, right?* 

*Toasting motion back at them, she downs the rest of her drink and  ah. Tolerance : 4. Forty-four /100 too. Hinoki seems to be finally pretty tipsy, with the previous drinks hitting her hard for a moment. A silly smile rests on her face and her cheeks are less pink, more red.* 

*She sets aside that glass* Could you make me a Mojito? ~ *Leaning forward with elbows against the table, she rests her hands on her cheeks as she watches them.*

Hehe. ~ We all want to be understood at our core, thats a good thing to value. ~ *Another giggle, and she ponders his question* 

Why did I lie thats a conundrum indeed. For white lies pertaining my hobbies and interest *She sighs.* Well, its just a little game of mine. Harmless, or at least its intended to be - to see what happens if I do it, I suppose. Theres not really much other reason, and considering its just a detail about me it doesnt really matter what I say. My interests are, uninteresting. ~ 

For my next question, Id like to prompt a scenario : Lets say you learned something thats bound to hurt another, or cause extreme distress - however, this information is important for them to eventually know. Would you break it to them, or lie about it for as long as you can? ~
||kyunu||*Taking the drink in her hand as they finish making it, she smiles as she looks into it.* "Perfect choice. ~ You're quite the barkeep." *Taking a small sip of it, she listens along to their answers, eyes hazily following Mirai's movements around. Leaning away from the counter, she places her hands in her lap.* 

"Hm. ~" *Nodding with responses, pausing on the one related to Mercedes, she doesn't directly respond to any of it in particular just yet - and instead jumps to the question.*

"I... ~ will keep that one to myself." *Grinning, she giggles.* "Or maybe I just want to keep drinking a little bit more. I don't know about you, but I'm barely feeling this." *She'll take a few good gulps of her drink, setting it down halfway... Tolerance : 17 & 78/100... Cheeks are pink, but jeez... Still seeming pretty sober.* 

"Even though we both didn't expect it, considering Mercedes likely planned to pit us against each other for a show, you still worked with me, too. That's thanks worthy enough. ~" *Giggling a bit at the thought, she'll consider her next question...* 

"What do you value most? In another person, or yourself..."
||kyunu||"Hm." *She's watching with a smile, and Hinoki promptly leans against the bar counter again as she thinks.* "If you're taking requests... Hmmm... ~ How about another surprise? I'd like something that's bittersweet." *She pushes her old glass to the side.* 

*The next explanation to her question... she doesn't seem upset with the description, rather, taking it in and coming to understand their experience. Her eyes trace over the electrical burn, memorizing it before her eyes glance back up to Mirai.* "That's..." *She doesn't really have the words for a moment, pausing to form some together mentally before speaking.* "I'm sorry you had such experiences. It sounds... painful." 

"..." *Hinoki tilts her head at Mirai with a smile, warm despite their conversation ebb and flow.* "Leaving you alone in that precarious situation wasn't on the table. I'm grateful to you, too. Thank you." *She bows her head respectfully to Mirai, smile still fitted on her face.* 

"Pets... No, I've never had a pet. I didn't have the time as I got older and, when I was younger I couldn't have one. ~ Now, if I *could* have one - a lavender hognose snake would be cute." 

"Do you have any siblings, or are you an only child?"
||kyunu||"Hm... ~ Well, I'm open to all your curious questions. I'm surprised you didn't hate me when we met... you're kind." *She nods with that thought.*

. . . That question. 

`CHA: 23 (You can try to perceive but that's what you're beating...)`*Hinoki stares right back at Mirai, eyes relaxed and body entirely calm as they ask. Her smile remains on her face as she looks at them.* 

"No. ~" *Is her simple answer, which sounds like the pure truth. Her eyes flick down to her drink, and mere moments later drinks her entire drink right in front of them. Gulp... gulp... gulp...* "Hah... ~" *She sets the glass down in front of her. Tolerance : 15.* "We've been doing a whole lot of talking and not enough drinking. ~" *Giggling to herself, she looks around idly about the bar.*

"I've got to up the ante. `...`"
||kyunu||8...
||kyunu||"Right, I have few wants. ~" *She hums a little tune, taking a sippy sup of her drink, calm as ever in front of them. It's difficult to tell what more she could be thinking, really.* 

*Listening along to him, she keeps her hands cupped around the bottom of her glass, tapping it idly. As they finish speaking, she'll respond.* "Hm. ~ I'll save my thoughts for another question, that's quite a lot to take in." 

"My parents... they're dead. The person who raised me is also, dead. I have no surviving family outside of here. ~" `Perception check. ` "It's a bit boring, really. Not even worth a footnote - my relationship with them is part of the past, as is their thoughts too, seven feet under." 

"Next question. ~ Do you hate me?" *Completely random question, unrelated to their current topic whatsoever...*
||kyunu||ok im done beating up my players ill reply soon LKJADWJKA )
||kyunu||brb running a one shot ]
||kyunu||15... She's totally calm, and it seems like it could be the truth!
||kyunu||"Hm. It's not a need, if anything it's barely a want - simply... " *She taps her glass gently, thinking for a moment.* "...This world... is bound by societal expectations and the status quo. I think everyone should be free in all their emotions, undefined by restrictions such as morals : good, or bad. I suppose I did it because I liked seeing the range of that potential freedom. For *fun*." 

*Quite the response from her... But, it does sound honest... right?* Perception check.

"Here's another question for you : Why do you feel the need to sacrifice yourself for the sake of others?" *An equal, pointed question back to them.*
||kyunu||"Hm. ~ I think to a degree, I understand. However..." `. . .` "You'll need to ask another question for any more of my thoughts, though. ~" *An oddly placed tease.* 

*As she listens along to his response, her eyes darken a bit - but her smile doesn't fall from her face. Her face relaxes as she listens along, finding herself quiet through it.* 

"Hm... ~ That's... well, there's no other way for me to put it other than that it sounds awful." *Pretty straightforward on that one. Tracing over the scars on their arm, her eyes flick back over the them with a smaller smile.* "Parents... can be quite a handful. I can't imagine that experience was good at all, but... I'm glad you seem to have already come to terms with it, or at least have begun to understood it, one way or another." 

"I hope what you learned has become yours, and yours alone. ~" *She takes a small sip of her drink.*
||kyunu||*Hinoki taps the bottom of her glass, listening along to his response. Her eyes gradually fall down the teeth impressions, and she focuses on them for a moment before glancing back up to him.* 

"I agree with you there too - that's certainly the alternatively.  Even if someone claims everything's supposedly all sunshine and rainbows, there's still bound to be a cloud lingering the distance." 

. . . "Hmm.. ~ quite a lovely question." *Pausing for a moment as she ruminates over it, she'll respond quietly...* `. . .`

"Well, that aside - my turn for a question." *She points to their body.* "How'd you get those bite marks?"
||kyunu||*Hinoki giggles at his comment, still leaned over the counter as she watches them with a hazy gaze. Eyebrow raised as they attempt to make the next drink, she hums.* "Take your time. ~" 

*Eyeing their second attempt to make the drink, she watches the drink swirl as it's poured in front of her- finally leaning away from the counter to clap at the next bar trick with a grin. Letting her elbows rest again on the counter with hands clasped together in front of her, she continues to listen to his answer- needless to say, surprise and curiosity are most evident on her with all of the... different, familial relationships he has.* 

"Hm. Seems like you had quite the chaotic family, then. ~ I agree with you though, but, I have seen those who... have no issues at all. Must be nice. ~"

"So, what question would you like to ask me? ~"
||kyunu||*Uttering a low chuckle, her eyes drift to the side as she reminsces.* "People who enjoyed trying to chat me up for a deal... egotistical business individuals, arrogant socialites... Oh, but it's quite fun really. Sometimes I'd stay late and play a few *games* with them." *: D Haha! She laughs heartily at that. But, boy she must be a handful.* 

"Hm ... ~ Right, I almost forgot that promise... ~" *Oh? Mirai helps her open the surprise- and her eyes widen as she looks at it - it's so glittery! She giggles a bit as she looks at it, but she'll let the glue dry first...* 

*Matching Mirai, Hinoki drinks the rest of her own glass- Tolerance : 11... Her cheeks are just a tiny bit pink, but otherwise she looks completely fine. She pushes the glass to the side.* "Could I ask you to make me a Daiquiri? ~" 

"Questions... questions... Careful now, I might get you pretty drunk in the first few." *She teases, chuckling a bit as she leans forward, pressing her elbows against the bar and hands folded under her chin.* "... What would you say is your biggest gripe with your family? Or, perhaps you have no problems at all with them." *Not a super normal question, but it's a relatively tame one.*
||kyunu||"They can get quite chaotic, indeed. I like going just before happy hour, when no ones really around. ~ It's a bit early, but it helps me avoid certain fun characters." *A small laugh escapes her as she watches them pull out the surprise, and giggles at the drawing of her.*

*Before opening it, she listens to their response, smile resting on her face through it.* "Thanks, I appreciate it. ~ I'm sure with some honest answers to your questions will help make up for it - it's the first time we've spoken properly in a while, so needless to say I'm ecstatic." 

*-1 STR... She... can't open it. Hinoki is fidgeting with it but like, it kind of looks sad.* 

*As she struggles, her focus is down to the paper.* "I'm always down for a fun game. ~ How about... truth or drink? I promise I won't drink too many times on my turn." 

*She grins to herself as she continues to struggle...*
||kyunu||*Hinoki's eyes can't help but follow his tricks, mouth forming a little 'o' as she watches with excitement. It's all pretty impressive to her, and she has a bright smile on her face as they're doing it.* 

"Uwa ~ you're so talented, what a pretty drink!" *She's watching the shimmer as she wraps her fingers around it, pulling it closer to her* "Aaa. ~ I almost can't drink something this beautiful...." *With a hum, she takes a sip of the drink.* 

"Hm hm. ~ I'd like to know the surprise, but first..."

"I wanted to apologize- well, for more than just what happened in the backrooms. When we first met, too." She'll begin, speaking a bit slowly as she looks down to her drink, and then back up to Mirai. "There's a lot to apologize for, but I won't go down each line." Another sippy sip of her drink. 

"I'm sorry." A simple, loaded apology ensnared with numerous past experiences. "The request to go out to drinks was so that we could properly speak equally. I have a feeling there's quite a bit you'd like to ask me, too. ~"
||kyunu||*Hinoki has settled in a seat at the bar, smile on her face as she watches Mirai come in and finish his drink.* 

Hmmm. ~ Id like something mixed, could you make me something sweet?
||bellboy||MB LEMME EDIT

||bellboy||*Kali closes up.* " I'll take a cosmo. Please clean up after. " *Off he goes.*

Oh! Wow! ~ *Hinoki claps excitedly!!*
||kyunu||<@196879022909554689>
||kyunu||*Dont be so judgy a girls gotta indulge* 

*She smiles warmly at Kali. If flowers could appear around her, they would.* 

Thank you. ~ Again. ~ *Shell turn her attention to Mirai* 

I always like a few options. Can we pull out a red wine and a whiskey bottle too? ~
||bellboy||*He looks at Hinoki....*

||pulsatilla||Yuumi takes a moment, before leaving as well! Great talk lesbian!
||kyunu||*Annnddd out.*
||kyunu||`. . .`
||pulsatilla||<:smeee:1269374718956408943>
||kyunu||"Not a fan of mysteries? ~" *She thinks for a moment.* "That's a good quality to have though, I don't mind it one bit." *Hinoki nods, pleased with that response.* 

"I'll answer your question, then." 

`making this a private thread!`
||pulsatilla||"Odd." He repeats himself.

He doesn't say anything further about his comment, just moving on easily to answer the question.

"Because, I prefer knowing the people I intend to work with. I'd be a fool to entrust myself with someone who's merely a mystery."
||kyunu||"Odd?" *She exhales, grinning a bit.* "I'm curious, why did you want to know more about my thoughts, or, feelings?"
||pulsatilla||"Odd." He hums, returning his gaze to his glass.
||kyunu||"... It's not that interesting. I'd rather not get into any of that. ~" *She sips from her glass again. (Tolerance - 13...)*
||kyunu||15 - dms...
||pulsatilla||17 <:smeee:1269374718956408943>
||kyunu||yuhhhh
||pulsatilla||"You have feelings such as...?" He's gonna let her keep speaking, as Yuumi has not much to say on what's been said already. He's just learning. 

And... can I roll charisma to get a littol deeper glimpse at Gnocchi.....
||kyunu||. . . Hm. ~ 

Ive found that mimicry pales in comparison to the real thing. ~ 

*She smiles at Yuumi, and listens to his thoughts about her, her actions, his impressions and Hinoki looks back down to her drink, swishing the liquid around in it.* 

Knowing what its *supposed* to feel like I have an idea, but, no, I suppose I dont. I have an impression from anecdotal experiences, and newer experiences of my own, which I believe I can label as happiness ~ *She seems to have sobered up a tiny bit from that question.*  However, as for feeling safe, or protected - I know what it looks like for others, but I doubt thats something Ill be able to experience.

Even I have feelings, regardless if thats something that cant be understood, or accepted.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<:buh:1218752782375583754>
||pulsatilla||...

"You lack what others have come naturally, and... you mimic them. I've noticed your small quips of laughter, the *giggling*. It's all forged, isn't it? When there's nothing to say, or do, you go with what's easy to be overlooked. A mere laugh, yet... I wonder if you've ever truly laughed at something before."

Now, full attention is on Hinoki, analyzing her words carefully.

"Do you *know* what it's supposed to feel like to be happy? Safe? Protected?"

"Do you even feel... ***anything at all?***"
||kyunu||"Not criteria - no. That's not what I would describe it as. It's an issue with me, rather than anyone else." *Another sippy sip.* "Those traits come as a natural need for others, but for myself - *happiness, protection, and safety* have always been a luxury in my life, if ever present at all."
||pulsatilla||"So there's a criteria? What makes your want different from a need? As far as I am aware, everyone needs protection, safety, and happiness. As they are the bare minimum we all seek when birthed into this world." He sets his drink aside.
||kyunu||*Smile... She looks down at her glass again, and her eyes slowly lift back up to look at Yuumi.* 

"Most people want to be happy, in some capacity. There are those who deserve happiness, safety, and protection - who *need* it. *I* don't need it. I *want* it. So long as it's a *want*, I'll never be meant for it. ~ " . . . *Her voice is light, as always. Another small sip of her drink.*
||pulsatilla||"Why don't you think you're meant for the stage? Or, in other words, good things?" He takes another light sip from his drink. He's not done asking questions.
||kyunu||*She thinks for a moment, looking into her drink. Hinoki takes another long sip from it... (Tolerance : 6 ... 29/100)* 

*Well, maybe if she were a little more sober... Her cheeks are tinted pink.*

"Yup. ~" *She pops the 'p' at that.* "I wasn't meant for the stage they're standing on- a supporting actor can't stand proudly by the main cast. Walking behind distantly rather than standing side by side... that's one I'm more suited to... ~" *Hinoki's eyes fall away for a moment, pausing again, before looking back to Yuumi.* 

*She sighs, and laughs into an apology.* "Aha ~ Forgive me. I've said too much. Is that all you wanted to know?"
||pulsatilla||`...`

"Even if you can't attain it?" Eyebrow raise. He fully expects Hinoki to give more clarity on what she means.
||kyunu||"Starting with a challenging one, hm?" . . .

*She pauses for a moment, thinking.*

"What do I live for..." *Another pause. She picks up her glass, and takes a sip from it. * "... a tomorrow where I can stand side by side with the people I care about, on a path that leads towards 'happiness.' That's the dream that keeps me alive, even if I can't attain it." 

`Perception check.`
||pulsatilla||"What do you live for?"
||kyunu||*Watching him pick up his drink, her face relaxes a bit. A short exhale, and her eyes drift back up him.* 

Go ahead. ~ Ill answer to the best of my ability. *She looks at him curiously.*
||pulsatilla||...

He reaches for his drink, and takes only the smallest sips from the rim of the glass. Contemplation.


"I do, at least, have one question for you... that may lead into multiple others if you've got the time to spare for it."
||kyunu||*Hinoki rests her hands in her lap, looking at him carefully. She doesnt answer for a moment, deliberating something. Her voice is a bit lower.* 

Alright - I understand, you dont need to explain. But, in recognition of what we spoke of earlier I know you dont see me for anything - thats fine : but, I dont want to sit around forever and offer no use. *Straightforward, her voice is quiet.* 

If theres something I can do, even if its small, Id like you to know the doors open. Were team members, and colleagues - its better to work together. 

That goes for anything though - not just what happened.
||pulsatilla||"I have an idea..." For once, during this whole conversation, his voice begins to lower. As if paranoid of the truth. "I'd rather not discuss it until I'm ready, though."
||kyunu||*Hinoki watches him, and her face remains calm as ever.*

"I see," *She begins again, placing down her cup.* "Then, do you know what attacked you and Asami, back there in the Gym?" *Back to the obvious question.*
||pulsatilla||"Then you'll need to purge it. If it keeps returning, and seeking out people to harm, then you'll need a priest."
||kyunu||( I sleep now <:ROSE:1091255842973683783>
||kyunu||Hm. ~ But if the creatures aggressive, how do you know leaving it alone will truly stop it? It could just keep persisting. *Sippy sippy the drink*
||pulsatilla||"Yes." Simple answer. "It does depend on multiple different factors, but any aggressive creature should be left alone else they'll wreck havoc."
||kyunu||(Shower time brb <:ROSE:1091255842973683783>
||kyunu||So if they exist, can they hurt any of us? *Curious question.* For example if we made contact with one, how dangerous would be?
||pulsatilla||"The supernatural and things beyond human comprehension such as anomalies do indeed exist within this mall."
||kyunu||If thats what you see ~ *Hinoki giggles.* The offers still there as a courtesy, though. 

Anyways, I have plenty of questions, sure, if youre willing to answer. *Shell stare at him with a smile. The obvious questions would be well, you know how Hinoki is. An enigma.* 

Is it true that there are ghosts here in the mall? The Chairman seemed to be seeing one in Minigolf. 

*She couldnt resist asking.*
||pulsatilla||"No, not really. I've said it already, you don't do anything, so I've got no interest in asking you anything." He stares at his glass... he hasn't touched it since Hinoki first poured it for him. "I'm sure you have questions for me, though."
||kyunu||*Helpful!* "Well, if you say so. ~" *She'll refill her glass with whiskey, and take another drink... (Tolerance - 10 & 79/100) Her cheeks are a bit pink.* 

*Sucking in a breath, she'll redirect her attention back to him.* "Anything you're curious about? If you are, you only need to ask."
||pulsatilla||"I have no preference on what I drink."
||kyunu||"Not liking whiskey? There's also wine." (:
||pulsatilla||"No." 
||kyunu||*Like talking to a brick wall. She grins.* "Fair enough, would you like another drink?"
||pulsatilla||"A reminder that everything you break has repercussions." He blinks.
||kyunu||"Seems like news gets around. What a pity. ~" *She'll reply with a laugh, eyeing his glass before looking back up to him.* "I wonder if we're both referring to the same thing, however."
||pulsatilla||"With all of that being said, I do hope you and Tiffany have learned your lesson when it comes to damaging property." He slides his glass away.
||kyunu||"Hm. ~ I appreciate the honesty." *She laughs lightly, smile on her face as she looks to him. Hinoki isn't necessarily surprised by it.* 

"As far as I've seen of Stevie, she seems quite nice - I haven't really been able to meet her though outside of the game. I saw her once in Clyde Wear..." *Reminiscing over the memory of Callista getting her cute navy-themed dress for that one party, her eyes will hazily wander before falling back to Yuumi.* "... Anyways, that's a shame. Thank you for explaining that to me - it's nice to have some context. ~"
||pulsatilla||"You aren't mindless, nor rebellious, but as far as I've seen you also aren't... anything at all. Whether that's a good thing or bad, I've yet to decide." He shrugs, Hinoki truly is just an enigma.

"He's annoyed because people are testing his patience. Stevie has been disrespected multiple times since her floor has opened us, she's done nothing to warrant such hostility. The mini-golf machine was damaged as well, just more insult to injury for her and him. Normally, I wouldn't care for his attitude or wellbeing, but Stevie I do care for. So, even if I dislike him, I understand where the frustration lies."
||kyunu||*She takes another drink as he mentions not avoiding risks - (Tolerance - 18), and she's still doing just fine. Not interrupting him, Hinoki will listen along attentively and allow him to say his piece - even with the pointed comments scattered throughout his overarching message.* 

"I'm not looking to make an enemy of our trumpets, or any higher ups, to make that clear." *She pauses.* "I hope you haven't been seeing *me* as mindless, or rebellious - though, I suppose I haven't made the best first impression on that front. I've recently learned here, courtesy of the Chairman, is that I... need to take a larger step back and re-evaluate."

*Hinoki sighs, looking into her drink with a smile.* "Well, I thought I was doing well for a bit. ~ He seems incredibly annoyed as of late, to no surprise though."
||pulsatilla||"I never said anything about avoiding risks." His gaze shifts to Hinoki, as if she had hit a nerve.

"Ive realized something about Baeyo and her mindless followers. They believe that the only way to take risks is through defiance cutting ties with the Trumpets and crawling back to them only when it serves their needs." He turns fully to face Hinoki.

"But you dont need rebellion to test boundaries. What you need is communication with the people around you. Making an enemy of Kazuo wont do you any favors. Youll gain far more by not being seen as an ignorant fool. I will congratulate Baeyo for her interest in wanting us out of this mall, but- again... when her efforts eventually put other's at risk..." He trails off, head shaking silently.

As for her question, he nods. "There will more than likely be another game."
||kyunu||"I appreciate the warning, I'll keep it in mind moving forward." *She'll watch him idly, eyes falling down to her drink. A thought passes, but, it doesn't form into words.* "...But, if we take zero risks, we won't know where the threshold is - where there's a boundary. In that way, I suppose I might be a glutton for punishment - I just like to be... ~ a bit more careful." *Not really meant to persuade, moreso to say it openly...* 

*Hinoki nods, clinking the ice cubes in her glass as she swishes the cup.* 

"Do you think they'll be doing anything else once the game ends? It's gone on for quite a while... it's almost hard to imagine it ending."
||pulsatilla||"We had a plan, and that didn't work out given the game's nature. The most we can do is put faith in our dice rolls."

He blinks, then shakes his head. "I know you aren't going to defend her, neither will Suyin. Not because you believe she's in the wrong- I doubt you believe she is- but because you're all spectators." His gaze traces back to his drink. "I don't ask for your relationship with her to try persuading you into anything, I merely wanted to inform you that parading with her while she acts like *this* may get you in more trouble than it is worth."
||kyunu||"I am." *She admits, lifting her drink to sip it.* "I'd hoped we could have been a united front as a team - or... well, if there was a plan, I would have liked to be in on it." *Hinoki sighs, swishing the whiskey in cup.* 

"All that to say, I'm not here to defend her. We *already* weren't doing well in aggravation ~ with this poor luck, we'll have to pray we make even third place."
||pulsatilla||"Well, given Baeyo likes testing our Trumpet, I'm not surprised he reacted the way he did. She's gotten herself in trouble before with Kazuo, during the first game, Old Maid." He sets his drink down, groaning. "If you want details, ask Kazuo, because knowing Baeyo she'll spin the story to paint herself in a better light." Meanwhile, Kazuo has no need to lie about anything regarding that.

"You're friends with her, aren't you?"
||kyunu||"I'm... guessing this isn't the first time something like this has happen? ~" *She raises an eyebrow curiously.*
||pulsatilla||"Well, you have to account for literally anything to happen when you have Baeyo as a teammate." Eye roll.
||kyunu||"That's good to hear." She'll reply shortly. "I'm fine myself. ~ Not that cleaning up glass was something I expected, but, not much else to do there."
||pulsatilla||"I'm fine. Given I'm no longer drenched in a vanilla shake." Slow blink. "And you?"
||kyunu||(: . . .

*She drinks a bit more. Hinoki knew that she'd need it for this conversation.* 

"Well, drinks aside. ~ Last time we met... wasn't in the best circumstances. How are you doing now?"
||pulsatilla||He takes his glass and swirls it around.  

"I don't find difficulty in talking." That's... not what Hinoki meant, probably... Sorry tiny reply...
||kyunu||*Blunt, but, at least he's polite. She'll make herself comfortable and start by pouring herself a cup of Whiskey over rocks. Sliding a similar cup closer to him, she'll lean over and pour him an equivalent drink - also, whiskey over rocks.* 

*As whiskey pours into his cup, she'll speak.* "We're in the same team - a talks been overdue. ~" *Straight to the point.* "Drinks make it a little easier, but, maybe that's more for me than you." *She stops pouring his drink, leaning away and placing the whiskey in between then. She'll take a swift swig of her drink, (Tolerance : 17) and she's doing just fine - just like a cup of fresh water...*
||pulsatilla||"Either." Sorry, he may be the worst drinking partner in existence.

"It is no problem, I've been meaning to eventually talk to you. Might as well do it now over drinks."
||kyunu||*She's so fucking happy right now. She'll walk back over to her drinking partner...* 

"Thanks for entertaining drinks. ~ Red wine, or whiskey for you?" *Still smiling, Hinoki will grab the appropriate glasses and find a place for them to sit - probably by bar comfortably.*
||bellboy||*He locks back up...* " Have fun. " *...and heads out.*
||kyunu||"Yup, thank you. ~" *Smiling, she'll bow her head politely again to Kali.*
||bellboy||" Is that all ? "
||pulsatilla||"I'm fine with whatever." He's not really knowledgeable enough to pin point his favorite alcoholic drink, he just goes along with whatever his drinking partner has.
||kyunu||"Thank you! ~" *She hums happily, pulling out a bottle of straight whiskey. If there's a bottle of wine, she'll nab that too... Glasses...* 

"Yuumi, would you like anything?" *Other than what she has.* <:please:1169841201332097085>  <@162025912227987457>
||bellboy||*Here ! He unlocks the alcohol cabinet !* " Get what you need " 

<@131145091178954752> <@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||Up and Out! If Citrus still remains he'll give him a side eye and nod of his head. Adios...
||bellboy||*Citrus just smiles and collects his cards. He's...happy.*
||pulsatilla||Yuumi makes no comment on Xavier, too focused on Citrus and his words mumbled to him.

"I supposed it is time for you to return to your work... Have a good day, Citrus." He turns away from him finishing the last of what's in his cup.

"And, good luck."
||bellboy||*Citrus waits for Xavier to leave....*

*...*

*He turns to face the other direction to let out a few silent laughs.* " It's....amazing how...his insults are that of a third grader......." *Xavier only continued to prove his points over and over again......what a prime example !* " Anyways......."

*He turns back to yuumi.*

" I will not play another game with you. It is safe to say you are not good at this. " *That and...that was just less fun !* " But I will accept this..."challenge" of yours. " *He leans in to weespor one last thing.*
||elainatime||Xavier glares for a second. And then goes to leave. But as he goes, he throws a final comment behind him: Its funny, out of the two of you I definitely thought *Citrus* would hit harder. Anyway bye enjoy your game!!

<@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just fixes his glasses and goes back to drinking.
||bellboy||" Leave. You were told to be quiet. That was generous. Seeing that you can't even do that, make yourself scarce. "
||elainatime||Xavier takes the punch like a champ!! `[Stamina: 18]` He takes the blow before stretching his jaw and massaging his cheek a bit. Bruh I guess I, like Was that just for like talking or what?
||bellboy||*Citrus stops what he was doing and aims to knock him out with a punch to the face. (16)*
||elainatime||14
||bellboy||roll dex
||pulsatilla||GULP
||elainatime||Xavier comes with them! Thats also metal as fuck. Killing yourself and then *resurrecting yourself through the flames of Hell*? I mean, are you kidding me??? Thats AWESOME! Um. I bet it? like, it probably totally sucked while it was happening though. Um. And Im like really sorry you went through that

<@242165436731359232>
||bellboy||" Uh....huh....." *Citrus keeps his eyes on the cards....he doesn't believe Yuumi, but he knows better than to argue with crazy people. It'll just go in circles.....hmmmm......* " `...` "
||pulsatilla||"Incorrect." He says, almost instantly after Citrus.

"I died." His gaze focuses to his cards, figuring his next move. "I died, but shortly after my death I self resurrected through the flames of Hell." He's recounted this story quite a few times here, each time he feels the need to just... dumb it down for people.
||bellboy||*Citrus slow blinks. Huh ?* " And failed. You are still alive. "
||pulsatilla||`cw... suicide....` "||I committed suicide.||" He takes a seat at the bar.
||bellboy||*Here ! Citrus preps some drinks...... and begins to deal the cards.....*

" What exactly do you mean by that ? "

<@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||"It is fine, no need to apologize." He shakes his head.

As for what he wants... He shrugs. He doesn't know drink names, all he's had within this mall is random mixture concoctions he gets at the parties. He signs something to Mirai... dms.
||pulsatilla||"..." He rises up from behind the counter, making a sour face. "That..." He trails off, because God damn dude. Too close for comfort!!

He walks back to the bar stool and sits, sighing. "Thank you."
||bellboy||" I'll drink it. I could use a drink...." *He locks the bar up again and shoots a finger gun.* " Make it alcoholic ! " *He walks off.....*
||bellboy||dont make me make you roll
||pulsatilla||
||bellboy||*Here. He unlocks the bar.......* " Get what you need. I'm trying to be a little more strict about this stuff......." *He remembers the one party he went to.......sickening.......*

<@196879022909554689>
||pulsatilla||He looks at his device... stands up and Uh. UH. UH. HE'S GONNA... GO HIDE???? SOMEWHERE??? BEHIND THE COUNTER YES
||pulsatilla||Nods.
||bellboy||yes !
||pulsatilla||A sigh of relief... he didn't want any eavesdroppers for this.
||pulsatilla||"..." He looks around.

"*Cabinet.*" He whispers.

He looks back at Mirai. "Do you know sign?"
||pulsatilla||Teleporting. Idk my way through this mall. He takes a seat at the bar...
||pulsatilla||A text! He gets up and leaves.
||pulsatilla||Here... sitting... and then slamming his head down onto the bar counter.
||.wozwald.||"Life would be boring if it was so
||.wozwald.||So:Bro is on the dip grind
||.wozwald.||(( Will thread this pio 
||.wozwald.||"Life would be boring if it was so linear - Even handouts need a bit of strife to make it right ~" Was his answer , but he's a man of madness himself : One who works for the disastrous world , ironically to ensure it's all made right.
As for how he's managing a conversation with the other right now - *Honestly* it baffles him , that sort of ability to easily speak and converse even with the enemy.

  `Call it just a casual chat.`

But it's refreshing to speak so casually with nothing on the table.

" That's why people aim to remove the factor of chaos , where consequence no longer exists : Everyone aims for the perfect world, yet the idea of perfection is always changing."
||bellboy||" I do not care about the games. " *He corrects blankly.* " I merely work under those who do and do it well. " *And he couldn't be anymore honest than he is was this very moment. This next question though....it was odd to him.*

*He takes some time to answer it as the option of not working had never crossed his mind.* " In a perfect world, yes. I would not work as there would be little to no capitalism keeping me from access to survival, however, I can see how it could mean disaster for others. Some have work as their purpose and therefore could descend to madness without such a thing. Guess even in a world of handouts there's chaos, isn't there ? "
||.wozwald.||"Hm ~ Who knows."

Elbow rested on the table , plastered with a face of content. "I know my purpose : So seeking to live seems rather a waste knowing what I ***want*** to achieve." Just at the hands of another , he doesn't need to heed to their beck and call... Eyeing the contents, shaking his head with a brief sigh. "So is your purpose to see this game through - You live for this game and thus you survive to see it." Assumed wholly to be the case.

   `A MAN WHO WISHES TO FEAST MUST WORK.`

Soseki took his hat off , placing it to the side, not that he's open to having a drink , but it doesn't mean he's negating the idea if offered. "The rules of the world indicate that fate is one that is followed by every living person , and to go against those rules must mean you're prepared to pay a price : So if your work meant giving up your right to survive, would you stop working?"
||bellboy||" Human rights that I shouldn't have to work for. " *His beverage stirs with the idle twist of his wrist. Hm.*

*Citrus's body finally twists to actually face the person he's talking to. A mild interest in the man makes him worthy of this thing called attention.* " I don't desire money therefore it is not my purpose. I work to survive much like everyone else in the world. I did not make these rules forced onto me I just follow them because I have no option but to do so. " *He takes a slow sip of his drink, feeling less of a rush to numb his senses.* " I take it you seek reasons to live considering you want to add what's mandatory to the list of purpose ? "
||.wozwald.||"Created for money . . ."

   That's just another mindless desire though , isn't it - The exact thing Citrus believes is mindless for purpose : choosing to keep his comments rolling though , Soseki only laughed it off with a simple chuckle. 
"Working for money - Created for : It's a mindless purpose though , is it not ? All people at the end of the day work for money. It's not just because you were created for it , but you *have* to work to have a right to eat. To have a right to live , that's how things are in this day and age now."
||bellboy||" No. " *He replies flatly.* " This is merely a mandatory part of my life as an adult. " *His decision is now made. A refill is needed so a refill he'll get.* " I firmly believe that working towards anything is nothing more than the mindless desire for purpose within the average human being. " 

*His breath is held for a good 30 seconds as he concentrates on the pouring of his drinks. The cream and bourbon crash into one another smoothly thanks to this caution...the hassle of cleaning up after himself, he wanted to make sure such an event never existed.* " I do not search for a purpose I already received in birth. That kind of insecurity isn't necessary. I work for what work was created for: money. "
||.wozwald.||"Suppose I do - If you can't make work entertaining for yourself : Instead of standing lonely in the corner you have to present the opportunity for yourself . . And ironically , it means you have to perform the lonely role in that corner."

    Or something like that - For the game ahead , even in a transitional phase there's always development if you keep an eye out : He knows that much all too well himself.

"So say you do as well , how's the work life for you then ? Worth working towards?"
||bellboy||" Absolutely. Much better things, however, much like the others, my job takes priority. " *Sip.* " Though we are in a transition phase so work is slow at the moment. I would much rather keep busy. " *His glass is set on the counter, nearly empty as he debates a refill.* " You enjoy people watching ? " *He asks but he doesn't really care. Anything to make wasted time more interesting.*
||.wozwald.||"We can agree on that much - But I have no intentions of interfering with the peace here right now , I'm enjoying just being able to see it all play out . . Otherwise , what about you ? Waiting for something to happen or will you spend your time wasting away on the drink?"

   Raising a brow , before he began copying the motion prior , tapping his finger on the counter.

"I'm sure you could have it better spent."
||bellboy||" ..." *His posture slowly loses it's correctness as his head dips into an annoyed expression.* " Likewise. " *Why else would he be out ?* " Boredom is all consuming. I hate it."
||.wozwald.||"Of course , of course."

   Just a light chuckle , heaving a relaxed sigh , facing forward towards the endless bar of drinks : The tapping of the finger was prety much an indicator that he's not pleased with the others appearance.  "For what I want - Not much , I'm here to pass the time , is that not such a bad thing~?"
||bellboy||*Citrus stops the top abruptly with an aggressive tap of his finger. Any stronger and it would've made a small dent in the wooden counter.* " Spectators ? " *He has no idea what bro is on about.* " I am allowed to indulge in what's provided to me. " *Sip.* " What do you want ? "
||.wozwald.||Well - That's a surprise , someone here alone must make them quite the loner , not that he's regarded in the same boat except he undoubtedly is . .  
waltzing up without a shred of hesitation to them , making their presence known with a light whistle.

   "Drinking on the job now ~ ? My I wonder what the spectators would say."

A light joke , to set the tone ; Soseki then took a seat next to Citrus , only to watch the spinning top.

||.wozwald.||<:gabcontemplation:1189345837931827270>
||bellboy||*Here....it's drinking hours....he pours himself a glass of bourbon and mixes it with a cream liqueur.........He sips while spinning a spinning top on the table. Bored.*

<@508392044599705601>
||sadpastry||She hugs him back tightly, somehow managing to balance in her seat despite the force of his hug!!!
||sadpastry||She opens her arms. A hug is satisfactory. 
||sadpastry||Yes, when it is invented. She smiles warmly, turning to face him in her stool.

I love seeing you too. Thank you for indulging me! I had a very lovely time.
||sadpastry||Goodbye Uno!! To Dante now. Em-Ell-Pee???
||helminthic||Uno stands up. "I will be back later." He says and exits the room!
||sadpastry||.I have never seen whatever you are talking about, but I believe you, Dante.
||starzono||PREACH DANTE PREACH
||helminthic||Uno nods. "Thank you, Dante. This is exactly what I wanted to hear."
||helminthic||"Yes. Dante is telling me all about his idea for a My Little Pony reboot and is too embarrassed to bring it up."
||sadpastry||Are you two alright?
||sadpastry||Callista blinks.
||helminthic||Uno is ALSO typing. But not furiously.
||helminthic||Uno is typing. Looking up at Dante then goesback into his phone...
||helminthic||"Despite dedicating many years my life to words-- studying, dissecting and learning them-- it is hard for me to admit that I am at a complete and utter loss of them." He says, whipping out his phone.
||helminthic||"It absolutely is. This is your fault..." Uno says, stretching the elastic loops of his mask over his ears and neatly putting the cloth back into place. "Huzz...ah."
||sadpastry||Huzzah!
||sadpastry||CALLISTA TAKES HER SHOT.
||helminthic||"Well, I already took mine...." He gestures. "It's your turn."
||helminthic||Uno is chuckling a little. His shots r getting 2 him!
||helminthic||<@220287412230815744> WAITER!
||sadpastry||I am ready to shoot! She wants a shot.
||sadpastry||SHE SPIIIIINS OVER.
||helminthic||Uno cheers! Looks over at Callista and waves her over excitedly. <@901984511892553739>
||sadpastry||Can I have one?! mama PARTYING RIGHT NOOOOWWWW
||helminthic||Uno takes down his mask and puts the straw between his teeth, sucking every last drop out of his little glass. He shakes his head and his mouth makes what it can of a puckered sour face.

"Consider this me yelling. What are you doing about it?"
||helminthic||<@220287412230815744>
||helminthic||Uno leans in the tiniest bit closer...... And offers his hand. "Please, big man, I need it."
||helminthic||14 babe!
||helminthic||Uno does a double take then leeeeeeans in with his eyes squinting. It's obvious that the squint was from a large smile. He picks his straw back up and pokes Dante in the nose with THAT.

"Oh, I'm just so terrified. I've never drank alcohol or done hard drugs in my life.

I think you need to take a shot with me."
||helminthic||"It is most likely goobertl being feminine. And those are NOT two different words, they are just two different forms of words in your conlang where there is grammatical gender.

But I will give it to you.

Pour me a shot."
||helminthic||Blink. "What do they mean?"
||helminthic||"I said I would take a shot if you invented a new word for me.

Now you need to come up with two." Uno pokes his nose.
||helminthic||Fogot I was Roleplayong ty kay for the reminder 

Uno gives Callista a look of "We can continue later" before he unhands her and turns to Dante. "That sounds like a great idea--" he says and meets him back at the bar.

"You still need to invent a word for me, stud."
||sadpastry||He will be okay. If he gets into a certain state, I am a nurse! I shall aid him! She seems proud of this fact before awkwardly laughing with his first question, assuming hes joking. Aha *noooooo*

Her gloved hand finds his and squeezes it gently. Itd be *quite* sad, but luckily enough, we are both here. While I am surprised with this development between is, I am joyous it is happening. 
||helminthic||Totally fell asleep. He looks over at Dante for a short moment then shoots back to Callista. "Maybe he shouldn't have had a nightmare whatever it is he made..."

He listens to her sweetly and clasps his hands together. He does not realize that prying is no bueno. He is just curious!!! "Were you locked away in a tower or something?"

Uno reaches out to hold one of her hands again. "If you agree to it being pleasant, then of course. If we weren't here, I'd miss the opportunity to talk to you. How sad would that be?"
||sadpastry||Hes filling the void Thats enough for her. It helps that hes a good dancer.

Even as he grabs her shoulders gently, she shrugs to show that she doesnt really know how to reply. So, she settles on, I do not know. I wasnt allowed to go out very much.

As sad as that is, she still grins! Now I am here though Dancing in a bar, attending parties, making friends.. So it is a shockingly pleasant change of pace, despite the hardships that come with being here.
||helminthic||Uno hums a little to himself-- a song that is most likely unknown by Callista. Did he make it up or was it facts? No one will ever know. 

When she returns from her spin he grabs her gently by either shoulder. "You do keep saying that.

Why is that?"
||sadpastry||I dont mind if it doesnt match up. Earlier, there was just conversation! Awkward silence might be one thing, but as long as we keep chatting, I am content. The spin was especially exciting. She giggles as she twirls, something shes actually good at!

Spinning is her idle animation, after all. When her hand finds his shoulder again, she squeezes it gently. Oh! But, um, yes. I only really knew who The Smiths were, and.. that is it. Like I said, I do not get out much.
||helminthic||Uno's eyes crinkled with amusement. "You haven't heard a lot of music?"

He gently spins her before pulling her back into the rhythm of their waltz.

He pauses for a moment, considering the song that she mentioned, making sure she didn't stumble when he paused. The doctor's got a good grip on her. "Twist and Shout is absolutely a song I'm familiar with, though I can't promise my moves would match up..."
||sadpastry||She smiles warmly up at him, glancing down at her feet to make sure she wouldnt step on him before confidently making eye contact again. She trusts his lead and follows in suit easily enough!

Only because you are doing fantastic. A very basic waltz was something she had just done, so the movement was familiar to her thankfully. The question catches her off guard though

Mmm.. I do not know many songs, unfortunately, but someone played Twist and Shout at the last party! It was a lot of fun, so.. I suppose that song. Are you familiar with it?
||helminthic||Raised eyebrows. Yeah, he's a studmuffin and he knows it. Uno's eyes squint with a smirk. Uno starts to lead,  gently guiding her with a slight pressure from his hand on her back, to direct the movement. 

Now, he is not an expert but he moves confidently anyway. 

"You're doing good," he states, trying to keep eye contact with her. His usual stoic expression was softened by the warmth in his eyes.

He's doing, or trying to do, a very basic waltz. 

"What are you picturing us dancing to?"
||sadpastry||Well, *thank you.* She gets a little quieter, sheepish from his kind, blunt words. That means a lot to hear that from someone like yourself. A studmuffin, she means!

Her hand is easily placed on his strong shoulder, and she seems pretty comfy with where theyre at aside from her usual awkwardness. This is perfect, yes. Thank you, Uno.
||helminthic||Uno waves off her comments dismissively. He is trying to be humble. "I may be an avid researcher of language but this makes me no expert on dance. Don't put yourself down. You are *beautiful.*" 

He takes one of her hands and places it on top of shoulder. His blazer has shoulder pads, sure, but his shoulders are quite strong without them. 

After that, he places one of his hands on her back. 

"Is this okay?"
||sadpastry||Ah *Aha* I am hardly any of those things, *please.* Besides, you were the handsome scholar going on about Shakespeare, no? You flatter me! 

He doesnt! She, however, is trying desperately to keep cool or whatever. The blush on her cheeks and awkward demeanor give her away, though..

Not at all! Where would you like my hands? She lifts up both of her gloved hands, ready for them to be moved either by herself or him.
||helminthic||"We *are*? Are you the singer? A stunner and a singer, you're a Renaissance woman," he teases.

The fact that she has no game is great for him, because then the corny lines will work on her. Uno doesn't even have to try! He takes a step toward her.

"Do you mind if I get closer?" He asks with a cute little head tilt. The doctor has learned to make his emotions very physical due to his facial obstruction.
||sadpastry||Callista also stands, taking his hand with a satisfied hum. She has no game period, its okay..

Stunner.. That is a first! It makes her giggle, so she gently guides him a little further from the bar. And I have done less with more. *We* are the music! Only hes likely going to be the one guiding her, in her head, so hell be doing more work.
||helminthic||Uno somehow, simultaneously, has 0 rizz and a lot of it and it is showing! He carefully looks over her facial features with half lidded eyes that read interest. 

"If only there was music," he says standing up and offering his gloved hand. "But if you insist, stunner."
||sadpastry||Something like that, yes. She deflates a little, still smiling. Its not like he was *wrong,* so she shouldnt really correct a fact.

Besides, he did a compliment sandwich! I doubt that, but thank you for having faith. Should we dance now..?
||helminthic||Uno puts a hand on his cheek. "You must've been a bit of a loser then." He says like that is not at all offensive. He always talks like he can't possibly offend anyone. His leg crosses over the other in interest.

"You're probably a better dancer than me even if you're just a beginner. I'd love to dance with you."
||sadpastry||DONT BEEEE ILY BESPPERPR

Callista completely faces him. Oh! I had no friends until I came here, I understand. People joke, I just.. do not understand all the time. And.. And even *despite* just meeting and socializing like this, first impressions are usually quite telling.

She blinks twice, staring up at him with pursed lips. Then, she smiles, her cheeks a lil pink.  Yes, I would I would enjoy dancing with you *very* much.
||helminthic||SORRY SORRY 


"I don't really have any friends. 

I have maybe two." Uno says, tapping his chin. He is interested in the fact that Callista keeps mentioning things about him. "Didn't we just meet?" He asks, turning his body language more toward her. "Do people here not joke?"

He leans in closer. "Do you want to dance with *me* sometime?"
||sadpastry||Why wouldnt you be the type? Her hands clasp together in her lap as she tilts her head curiously. You seem like you should have many friends and loved ones in your life As I said earlier, you are a fun and pleasant person to be around! You even *joke.*

And hes teaching her things!! She looks invested. I have not been to a night club! I only recently danced with others for the first time, honestly..
||helminthic||"It *could* be a good thing. If you want to be. Depends on who you like to hang out with..." Uno squeezes her shoulder tenderly before placing his hand onto his own lap. "I just mean I get around. Do my fair bit of partying.... I know I don't look like the type..."

He uses his hand to flip his locks.

"The club. Like a night club. With dancing and alcohol and cute drunk girls in the bathroom?"
||sadpastry||I Is that a good thing? Being a bit of an animal. I mean, you seem.. quite relaxed and pleasant to me! I am confused.

However *the club.* Her eyes sparkle. Oh! Oh! What kind of club? I would love to join one!
||helminthic||Uno puts his mask back on, slowly shaking his head. "Well, don't just say *that* to me. I am a bit of an animal. 

That bold comment: you'll make me feel like I could have ten more drink even if the bartender tells me no."  He puts a hand to her shoulder. 

"You should be at the club."
||sadpastry||Wh Dante, *no.* She got sidetracked!

Uno, you are not an alcoholic. I just.. did not go out very frequently, that is all!
||helminthic||Bye angel
||helminthic||"You guys are making me feel like an alcoholic..." Uno hides his eyes in his hand in an act of embarrassment.
||sadpastry||There are tears in her eyes as she looks at Uno, and her voice hoarse. I have never been to a real one, no.
||helminthic||he asks both of them...
||helminthic||They must've just taken straight shots of vodka or something. Just tasteless for no reason. Uno sticks out his tongue. "Dante-- that was a perfect shot."

He looks the others up and down. "Do you go to the bar much?" <@901984511892553739>
||sadpastry||https://tenor.com/view/cat-cats-cat-cough-cough-coughing-gif-23378607
||sadpastry||SHES COUGHING
||helminthic||Uno finishes slurping it up. He pats his scars dry and pushes his glass forward. "Yes, please, Dante."
||sadpastry||I do not know how to um.. She  stops herself and just. yeah, shell smile and hold the glass up.

..Huh Huzzah!! She doesnt know how to take shots so she does that thing where you store it in your cheeks and slowly drink it down. When shes done, her head whips down towards the bar counter and she WHEEZES.
||helminthic||Uno does not have any last words. He just starts cutely sipping his liquor like it is a milkshake and he is on a date.
||helminthic||<@901984511892553739> <@220287412230815744>
||helminthic||Uno did say he took his liquor neat, so the strength didn't matter. He grabs any straw available and pulls down his mask-- he puts the straw in and looks at everyone else. "Okay. 

Any last words, everyone?"
||helminthic||yay!!!
||helminthic||Did he pour Uno one? 

If he did, he pulls his nose out of his mask and starts smelling it.
||sadpastry||A shot? Her head tilts as she sliiiides the glass closer to her.

its okay vesper im mobile and also doing lil baby replies ur good.
||helminthic||Uno's brows furrow. "Is there... What is in a nightmare pumpkin swirl?" Sorry for baby replies im currently in a vehicle.....

"I take my liquor neat if you don't mind. Straw please..."
||sadpastry||Well, I have alcohol in my room too if we want more, but I am still a bit curious on what this Nightmare Pumpkin Swirl is! She makes little grabby hands for a cup.
||helminthic||"Dante, Do you have access to the cabinets?" Uno asks. "You can't unlock it, right?" He raps his fingers against the counter again.

"We could ask Xavier or Adiel if they'd spare some of their whiskey..."
||sadpastry||Oh! Oh, *haha.* Awkwardly laughing, she beams once again and sits on a stool beside Uno. That was funny! Much like Shakespeare being so.. silly. Yes, yes.. She rubs her chin, pretending as though shes more familiar with his work than she actually is.

To Dante, she gives him one finger gun. I would like that! I am okay with whatever, thank you.  <@220287412230815744>
||helminthic||<@901984511892553739>
||helminthic||"I apologize, Callista. I was only joking. I do remember you."

A sick ass sort of swagger. "Isn't it interesting how Shakespeare was able to create words and just bring him into vernacular like no big deal...?" He asks, his head tilting like he's dreaming about a lover. "Swagger, dauntless, lackluster, lonely, unearthly, undress."

Uno sits down at the bar and raps his fingers against the counter. "Yes, Only if you can come up with a new word while you do it."
||sadpastry||*oh* She frowns deeply.
||helminthic||"No, I've never met her before." Uno says like they didn't see each other last night.
||sadpastry||Yes.. Callista is also here! Oh! We just met, yes.  It is nice to see you again, Uno!!
||helminthic||Guess who is here agaon!!!!! Uno looks toward Dante and gives him a wink. "Hey, stud."
||yaoiprincess||Asami Im watching the stream right now why are you trying not to laugh was
||bananices||WHEE
||bananices||I hope it is not urgent.
||helminthic||Follow 
||bananices||WHAT
||helminthic||Assume he copies him
||elainatime||And then he runs out of the room.
||elainatime||Xavier gets a few plastic cups.
||helminthic||Uno also does.
||elainatime||And then immediately starts looking around the room frantically.
||elainatime||#
Are you fucking serious?
||elainatime||He turns to Etienne.
||helminthic||Uno steps back and ceases talking to Etienne. He's back with Xavier, and is staring at him again....
||bananices||"I'm unsure. I was told to pass it along." Shrug.
||helminthic||Uno shakes his head. "The orange?" And immediately walks up to Etienne. "What are you talking about?"
||bananices||Drinking....:)

"Oh, I'd love to join you." But he steps first toward Xavier, leaning in for a (slight) whisper. "Uh. The orange has been extracted."
||helminthic||Uno pulls up his mask after Etienne walks in. He's looking into Xavier's eyes like way too intensely.
||bananices||"I'm sorry to interrupt."
||bananices||"Good day, Adiel." They bow their head slightly toward them and smile.
||bananices||"Oh. Xavier. I've found you."
||bananices||Oh my gah it's Etienne... 

He seems to be carrying some urgency about him.
||elainatime||Oh! Shit, Im so sorry! Dude, thats like, so rude of me to assume that. My bad.
||helminthic||Come inn
||helminthic||Awkward....
||helminthic||Nothing is wrong! Uno furrows his brow. He's very quiet.
||bananices||Hey chat mind if a guy wanders in
||elainatime||2 :)
||helminthic||Uno backs up a little in defense but, looks at  Xavier and nods. "It's not a body mod... It's real. I--" he puts down the cup. Roll perception.
||elainatime||He glances up at Uno, and then sees his scar: "Dude! Wait- that's fucking *sick*, is that like, body mod?" And then stands up to get a closer look!! If Uno lets him.
||elainatime||Xavier missed the entire conversation up until this point. He was thinking about what ice cream flavors he would make if he had an ice cream store.
||helminthic||"Thank you, Adiel."
||helminthic||"That's great. I love Korn. I wonder when we could listen to Korn... Or something like that?" Oh, no. He brought it up. God damnit. "Well, I don't have any aversion to it. I just know other people stare so I wear this to make it stop and all... but I do not care."

He slowly unveils his face and reveals a left cheek with skin crawling over raw pink scarred skin. His left nostril is tall and open and his teeth are totally exposed! 

He takes a really long sip of the whiskey like he's taking a blinker off his cart.
||helminthic||"I see. We do live with freaks. But it's alright."

Uno shakes his head. "I'd love to, cutie. I just cannot drink without one...." he grabs the straw. "Do you mind if I pull down my mask?" Head tilt.
||helminthic||"Diversity makes it interesting... what do you mean diverse?" Yeah, Uno is screwed in the music department. He listens to Nickelback and Alice in Chains. What the fuck was he supposed to do? Lucky he doesn't know this yet. Let's keep it to ourselves. He takes the bottle in his hand and squints. "Do we have cups and a straw any where?"
||helminthic||That is excellent. Uno's eyes widen and he takes a step forward. "Serious?" he asks, then tries to seem less interested as to not come off like an alcoholic. "I've been missing out on partying..." he poopoos in a fake way.
||helminthic||Blink. "I almost got horrified. I realize I could just get cake and not actual food..."

Uno lookss over at the bar and turns to Adiel. "Hey, you know what I think I remember that... Having a bartender there." He smacks the side of his head like he's trying to get water out of his ears. "God. Wouldn't that be nice..."
||helminthic||"Like they don't even come with the *meals?*" Uno is devastated. All he eats is like 3 cakes a day.
||helminthic||"Sucks... ass?"

His eyes twinkled like a dog left of the side of the road.

"Like even the desserts?"
||helminthic||"I actually agree with you whole heartedly. I'm not sure if this is shameful of me to admit."
||helminthic||"Oh.

Not much has changed.

I suppose I should talk to more people then. I'm not suffering too bad yet. I want to try."
||elainatime||Xavier is so fucking confused. Hes trying to hide it but its not going well. Ummmmmm Usually we just, like. Suffer? Or like, have parties and stuff.
||helminthic||<@310530338294202368> <@240177262140325888>
||helminthic||Uno has no idea what to say to that. He shrinks into himself like he could feel his aura points getting sucked out of him.  "Uh..." 

"Well. Okay." He is quiet for a moment.

"I think we've had an extremely awkward mix up at my own hands. I fear I do not have a great memory. I won't bother you with the rest of my introduction. You've definitely heard it before..."

He stands up straighter trying to gain his aura points back.

"Where do you people go around here? To entertain themselves... I'm totally out of the loop."
||elainatime||Uhm. Xavier does know him a little bit! They met once at the food court. But Uno has fully convinced Xavier that this is the first time theyve met. 
Nice to.. Meet you. Sorry, I really thought Okay. Well, Im uhm. A musician. What about You?
||helminthic||"Doctor Ryuunosuke Yori," he says, putting a finger into the loop of his mask, pulling it up and off his ear for a second, "but please, skip the formality, just call me Uno."

He places the loop back and does the same to his other ear. "Ryuu also works. Or whatever else you can come up with."

His head tilts. "I'm actually not sure if I've ever met you. I just wanted to try and see if I could remember while talking... But I do not. No fear, I don't think you know me either.

What do you do?"
||elainatime||Yeah! Im Xavier. Are you, ummmm Sorry. I dont remember your name.
||helminthic||Uno now feels like a crazy person for even asking these questions. He crosses his arms and tries not to let this phase him. "Never mind. It was silly for me to ask. Hello, Xavier."

"I have n..." he pauses. "One second," and he takes out his phone. And his eyes squint up in a smile. "I do know you...?"
||elainatime||Oh, Hi! Im, uhhhhhhh, Im Xavier! Are you? Wait! I think we met Um. Before?
||elainatime||Xavier manifests into reality. 
What? Oh. Uhhhhhhh, I dont actually know It kinda sounds like like a meme or something?
Xavier isnt incelpilled and looksmaxcoded like Uno. 

<@233964292213309440>
||helminthic||Plsplspls
||helminthic||"Good for you for not having judgements," he says. "Although, I don't really think it's horrible to be judgemental. It is sometimes necessary..." Uno places his device back into his pocket. Seems like he was done with screen time for the time being. 

He gives a wave to Xavier. "I wonder what he could tell me about mewing and looksmaxxing."
||helminthic||Uno is typing at break neck speeds. He flips his vision over to Adiel when they mention that name. "He's like an STI in a college campus, really, isn't he?"

"You mention his name and immediately everyone and their frat mates have come in contact...

But, yes. It is Dante."
||helminthic||Uno is now fully clothed. "It actually didn't get infected, isn't that great? I think I have a particularly great immune system." He says, flipping his hair like your favorite shoujo anime love interest. 

"I don't take nudes. But if I did then they would be awesome."

He stares at his device. 

"Would it be normal to call me, a man, baby girl?"
||helminthic||He is texting now while buttoning his shirt back up.
||helminthic||Uno immediately takes off his denim blazer and drops it to the floor. He starts unbuttoning his shirt like this was a casual day time activity and opens it up to reveal a tattoo that was obviously done with a sewing needle while the artist was under the influence.

It's on his left pec. 

"Is it awesome?" He asks. 

"I actually don't think so. He's not very good at it."
||helminthic||Uno puts his hand on their shoulder now. The doctor is not sensitive and could probably take everything Adiel threw at him. He wouldn't label himself as sheltered. He's got quite the social life-- ignore that he just isolated himself in his room for a while. 

"Of course I have. My roommate tattooed him on me. Do you want to see?"
||helminthic||<@240177262140325888>
||helminthic||Uno's eyes squint in a way where you could tell he was smirking under that mask. "Yes."

"Very cute, Adiel."

Uno does a little golf clap for them in appreciation. "What else can you teach me?" He tilts his head all cute like.
||helminthic||Uno adjusts his mask so it rested neatly on his nose, "oh, it's just slang," he says. "Like involuntarily celibate.

You know, like, guys on 4chan and reddit who get absolutely no play so they start blaming women instead of the fact that they haven't showered in ten weeks?"
||helminthic||Uno is the dad giving the compliment at the supermarket. He would flirt with someone at the library-- although, this is a much more appropriate situation to flirt than the library. "Oh, *me?* You started it." He says with fake annoyance. 

Poke, poke.

"Oh, I see. I don't have social media. Well, I have twitter but that's just so I can view the vernacular of the new generation or whatever. 

Isn't it so interesting how we've become so wordpilled into using incel terms in this day and age...?"
||helminthic||That activated something inside of Dr Yori. He lets his lids lower a bit. "I'm already hiding the face, but does it not add to the allure?" He asks, voice dropping to something a little more playful. Self complimentary but he is not finished. 

He plays with his hair for a minute in silence before he stands up again to join the others more personably."It's good you're comely enough for the both of us." 

Uno crosses his arms. "Flossing? I don't have a clue what you're talking about."
||helminthic||<@240177262140325888>
||helminthic||"Oh my gosh, this is very embarrassing..." A hand raises to his mouth as if it wasn't already covered up in an attempt to hide himself. 

Well. Hide himself more.

"No, I don't remember you at all. I can't even begin to recall it," he says as he takes a seat in one of the cool chairs. "I have been a hermit in my room for a long while. It feels like I haven't made eye contact with another human being for a decade..."

He sucked his teeth. "Very personal. Also embarrassing.

Ah. What are you up to here?" Making casual conversation like he knew Adiel at all.
||helminthic||Scratching the back of his head, his brows furrow harshly. Major aura loss. "I apologize I don't think we've ever met before," Uno takes a few steps further into the room to eye down all of the decor and surfaces and seating. 

And the people, of course. 

He puts his arms in a lazy shrugging position before asking: "Well, were you drunk or on drugs?"
||helminthic||Upon hearing that last few sentences... He jerks up in response -- like the words seized him from behind and fixed his posture for him. "Uh..." 

"The drug guy?"

Shoulders slumping, Uno is back to his usual relaxed demeanor.... "The drug guy. Why am I the drug guy, am I missing something?" 

There's a moment where he tries to remember but he snaps his fingers, "Nope. I lost it. Who are you again?"
||bellboy||*Here. Kali looks at the selection here and....picks a few bottles...and a few glasses. He leaves.*
||helminthic||And there is a disturbance. One that fills the air so cold as if corpses were rising from the dead.

Mystery.... In linguistics professor form. 

Alright, it is not that dramatic but it has been awhile since Uno had run into, well, anyone. He walked into the rowdy room and was not very rowdy. His hands were in his pockets and head lowered. It lowered even more when he saw other people. What a rabbit! 

Uno's blinks an uncomfortably fast amount, looking at the others as if he was trying to make an imaginary friend vanish.

Hi guys. 

He does not say. This is Vesper speaking.
||elainatime||Nnnno, not here. Do you, um. Like daniel?
||elainatime||Daniel I think. Unless- Wait!! Is your Nephew named Flossing??
||elainatime||Oh. Uhhhhh, I guess I think yeah you were probably talking about that before. Whats his, um. Name?
||elainatime||What! Dont tell me what to do. He crosses his arms. My dance was way better than that.
||elainatime||Like your teeth? Uhmmmm I do it sometimes. Why do you, like, ask? Okay actually I dont really do it that much.
||elainatime||Oh, did you like it????
||elainatime||"Uhmmm, I was kinda, like, in that hole for a second... But also, like, okay. Is anyone else in here???" He looks around
||elainatime||Xavier is here!!
||snombi||<a:walkin:1058575685431603372>
||snombi||They shall.. walk....
||snombi||Her room was more than fine. She slowly nods once again and squeezes back onto theirs. "I'm.. sure.. and.. and.. yes.."
||snombi||"I'll.. me.. message him.. I'm.. s..sorry.." She still feels guilty either way. "I.. I wa.. I want.. to.. mnn.. stay.. wi.. with you, Mi.. Mirai.."
||snombi||"Be..because.. I.. I di..didn't.. he..help or.. ss..say.. anything.." She sniffles. "I.. I wa.. I was.. wa.. wait..waiting.. ff..foor.. for.. hi.. him in.. in th.. the.. lobby.. f..for.. a.. a while.. be.. because he.. he said.. he.. he wa.. wanted to.. se.. see me.. an.. and th.. then.. he.. he said.. he.. he.." He told her a lot of nice things.. It made her feel important, like she could actually help someone feel better. And she couldn't even do that right.

She knew it was because he got busy that he didn't come by, but.. still.. She felt.. she didn't feel too great about it. "Mnnhh.."
||snombi||"Wh..no.. I-" There's something she isn't saying, or well, struggling to say in the first place. "I.. I di..didn't.. wa.. want.. to.. to mmmn.. make.. make.. him up..upset.." <:guhh:1217178235423686748> She leans into Mirai instinctively.
||snombi||She looks a litte frustrated with herself, and she looks to Mirai. For whatever reason, she's tearing up? Why? Girl?
||snombi||"Nnn-" She looks like she wanted to say something again, but then Dante leaves and she looks like she did something wrong by not speaking her mind.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||SORAYA FIGHT BACK
||snombi||She looks his way and she tilts her head a bit. "N..nno.. umn.. I'm.. ss..sorry.." girl you didn't even do anything
||snombi||She did want to go with him.. Bats eyelashes. Her words get lost in her mouth for a moment and she kinda sputters a little bit. "Ahahhhe.. umn.."
||snombi||<:tbh_tiny:1112950112013009006>
||snombi||"I.. appreciate it.." She sighs in relief because she's dealt with so much loud stuff lately. She's about to say something else, but she stops herself.
||snombi||and omigosh hiii mirai...
||snombi||She waves back.. "H..hi.. Dante.."
||snombi||omigosh hiiii
||snombi||<:oh:954579164785152100>
||snombi||And now it's quiet. She sighs and stares at the exit, but she knows that Mirai and Tiffany are probably talking out there. She doesn't want to intrude, so she just kinda.. sits down in here and waits.
||snombi||She tilts her head.. She kinda feels like she missed something. Curse her not understanding social cues.
||kyunu||*Hinoki goes*
||snombi||"Please.." She's been awake for God knows how long.
||kyunu||*She had been a bit dazed and out of the conversation, and delayed to enter the rowdy room after them.* 

Hm? Im a bit tired. ~ Im sure were all looking to have some rest, yes?
||snombi||So does she!
||kyunu||19
||snombi||`[12]` she remembered she was important or something
||kyunu||<:xaviergasp:1214852666040127489>
||kyunu||*Shes kind of just humming to herself as shes thinking, though ends up looking between them.* 

Is everything alright? ~
||kyunu||*She steps out here!*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He can!
||elainatime||Xavier walks in. He looks at the hole and decides to go in.
||kyunu||Good to know. ~ Well then, in we go! 
  
*To the <#1230690459349680190> !*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||> They enter!
||kyunu||"How fun. ~" *Hinoki giggles, turning her head back to him.* "Well, I've been in twice now. Do you have a light?" 

*She pulls out her communicator...*
||kyunu||(I'm also gonna actually pass out now because I gotta work in 6 hours... must sleep.. gn!!   )
||kyunu||"It's here- this is the only spot I can think that they entered. It's not safe in the slightest. ~" *She says with a light sigh, and she'll pull back on the same panel she's used before to get in.* <@305913481113239552>  

(I know you're eepy so no worries if you're not responding till tomorrow!!)
||kyunu||*And directly into here, breathing a bit heavy at her speed walk. She's staring at a certain wall.* <@196879022909554689>
||snombi||hooray!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||now i know everyone
||maamthatsafederaloffense||SORYASALASKDGJASDASG'
||snombi||"I.. um.. fell through the.. floor the fi.. first time I.. went in.." She admits as she heads in with them.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||OH ADIEL
||maamthatsafederaloffense||one moment making sure u have perms
||snombi||Holy moly, a medkit. She's pleasantly surprised to see one of those and she nods her head. "It's alright.. I don't.. think we.. we um.. waited that long anyway.."
||snombi||<:teehee:1167677845284331590>
||snombi||oh my gah
||snombi||And now it's time to play the waiting game. Wahoo
||snombi||`[16]` okay maybe we cooked 

"Right.." She sighs and nods her head. Gosh, she hasn't felt like this in a while. It almost felt wrong to her. Ick.
||snombi||"Like, um.. What's.. going on.. in this building, I.. I mean.. I hh.. had a.. a feeling.. something was wrong.. a.. a long.. wh.. while ago, but.. with all.. the.. the weird noises, other.. other rooms, and.. and now people.. in.. in danger.. in the.. the upper floors.. I.. I just-" She was getting a little worked up over being so.. weak and useless. 

"I.. I want to.. find.. something, I.. I think.. I want to.. to know why.. things are.. the way they.. are here. And.. um. I can't.. do that by.. by crying.. and.. and doing nothing."
||snombi||`[7]` we ain't cooking shit 

"It's.. just.. um. I've.. stayed put long.. long enough, I.. th.. think.. I want.. to.. to know.. things.. too.."
||snombi||She blinks a few times.. She knows she can back away, but.. "..Stupid or.. not, um.. I.. want answers too. Or.. maybe a.. a way to.. figure something out.." She says as she scurries over to the familiar crack in the wall.
||snombi||She arrives.. yippie.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theres a crack further into the room 

> please know, since u havent been here before, there is chance of injury!
||sadpastry||She vanishes here!
||kyunu||*... okay back out!*
||kyunu||*Walking into here she stares for a moment.*

||kyunu||*Hinoki and Baeyo reappear here, before running off! Exploration! Fun!*
||kyunu||*Hinokis eyebrows raise with curiousity, hand dropping to her side as she watches the the door open, pleased with this revelation. She muses the possibilities, taking a few steps over to follow Baeyo.*

You were right- this is much funner without knowing the specifics in advance. Perhaps I wasnt far off the mark for comparing this place to an escape room. ~ *She giggles, prepared to follow her in.*
||aias_||"That's right. That isn't the only one, however. Personally I prefer this entrance, It leads to..." She pauses and squints for a seconds. Although it looks more like an eye twitch. Too bad her hair is down again. "..Well if we see it, we'll see it."

"Anyway--" Baeyo goes to the wall and moves her hand alongside the wall of the room, allowing her fingers to drag until they land on a certain spot. She pulls back on a certain panel and unlatches what appears to be a hidden exit door.
<@305913481113239552> 

"--Here's our exit strategy." She grins as she beacons Hinoki to the hidden door.
||kyunu||*Hinokis gaze flicks to the wall for a moment, before focusing back on Baeyo with her usual flat smile.*

No, Im not. ~ When we exited that room, I believe we had to go through the mall *She ponders, placing a hand to her cheek.*
||aias_||Baeyo is IN!
She gives Hinoki her full attention as she concludes her Ghost Story, nodding with a smile.
*Love and hate hm?*

She turns to her travel companion and flicks her head towards the wall.
"That it is. Are you aware of the various exits to the backrooms, Ms. Mu?"
||kyunu||*CHA (Deception): 22. Hinoki just looks like she's smiling as she turns away- observing the room as she continues to speak before looking back at Baeyo with a curious grin, at her final question.*
||aias_||12
||kyunu||"Terrifying, indeed. No matter where I went, there they were- a natural friendly foe. Perhaps it's simply a fabrication of the mind... Oh well! As I said : I prefer to view them as spirits, ghosts- rather than a *monster.*" *She sighs with satisfaction, placing a hand on her chest- she turned away from Baeyo as she looked around the room... Perception check!* 

"But nowadays, only shadows near my mind and heart... easily cast away by the trick of a light. ~ No doubt those ghosts linger. Hatred and love are two sides of a coin, a thin line that could be crossed at any moment, such is the nature of life and death and the mantra of the ghosts that follow me."  *She shrugs, giggling a bit.* 

"Is this our final stop?"
<@248897197935034378>
||.wozwald.||And with that he's gone
||.wozwald.||<a:trollvanish:739351280710844516>
||.wozwald.||"Nope - No name ~ ! Well , I told you *but* you seem oh so insistent on forgetting, I've given up all hope."

Saying that, he looked at his receiver, seems something came up. "Well Thelma - I'll let you stew and figure it out in your own time, something came up for me personally and whilst I'd love to stay and chat, there are frankly. . . Other matters I must attend to."

Shooting her a quick finger guns, pew pew.

"Ciao my new friend ! I'll catch you on the flopside!"
||.wozwald.||Anti alcohol PSA right here
||frooztiez||busy bee..,,..

She blinks once, then twice, then attempts to turn her head towards her own sword. ...she's the only person around here who has a sword...?? But... ``[IQ: 8]``... it couldn't have been *her*, right? Does she sleepwalk? Theri doesn't think that she sleepwalks... but she's asleep during then... could she sleepwalk? Sleep*kill*? 

It makes her feel just that more anxious as she continues to listen to him speak, beginning to pick at her sleeves as she ponders the possibilities of murder. 

"..yyyeaa.hh,,     uum., ,  drinking is        baad.,, uuh.,, aand it should b ee        put of.f.., forever..,, uum.., aand burned..., probably.,,,  ii think..,,    yyyou could.,,, uum.,.,, uujmm,m.                yyuouo could.,,               .,.." What does she do when she's not drinking, which is... always..? "...pplaaay fortnite/..., uuyyeah.."

"....................          uumm.,nhh.                     doo you have.,, aaa, ,                                                                             nnname..,??" Her voice squeaks out, almost unsure if she's even allowed to ask. If he had one, he probably would have lead with it, right? ohogh..,
||frooztiez||(WILL RESPOND LATER I HAVE WORK )
||.wozwald.||There's unfortunately. . . *Many more.*
Now he's taking a look at that sword - Wondering if it's just a prop, or if she's a protag in some sort of fantasy/mystery duo... One that slices the red words with blue. 

  "They had huge gashes, like a sword was the weapon used."

 Coincidence, right?
He's only teasing - But why not, the one of many names needs a cool story.

   "It isn't as fun as people make it out to be - You think you'd achieve some sort of new liminal feeling but really it's a distortion : Ah ~ Not to put off drinking though, but surely there's better things, right. . . Theory?"
||frooztiez||A shiver runs up her spine for reasons that are beyond her understanding. so many names...

Speaking of the sword, she's managed to use a few extra articles of clothing to secure it onto her back, acting as a sheath of sorts. It's not that comfortable, but it works.

"... uuum..,,  hhow did..,, they die???" Still entirely unsure of these 'deaths', she'll take a few more steps into the room. It's warmer in here than out there...

".... nnnoooo.??.,......uum.,,.,.    alcohol is ,        very bad and evil,.,., so  ,, uum.,,. drinking is      wrong...     yyyou shouldn't.., fdrink." His eyes reflect in her warbly ones, unsure if they'll break or continue to barely stick together.
||.wozwald.||He had /MANY/ names to turn her into , its just the beginning  Yet first like scorched skies would burn those that fly, Theri was lucky to not fly close and evade that party.

Scratching his chin, not even acknowledging the sword as her questions were asked Pondering if dead people could be okay.

   Im not sure. . . Dead people dont really have a sign to show if theyre okay.

Like the soulless stare of fish, thats how he views it. Have you ever gotten yourself drunk, Thee Stallion?
||frooztiez||"...hoooohh...." She lets out a sigh of relief, thank GOD she missed it. Dante is just... still too much for her tiny heart. It's surprising that she hasn't had a heart attack, actually, with all of the small stresses of being here. If only they had a sauna just for her...

His sudden words make her jump a little, succeeding in startling the short woman. Did someone die? Ohhgh,, ,. goood.,, soomeone DIED><, - - no, no wait this is her D1 hater... he's probably just messing with her... It doesn't stop her from holding her sword just a little bit tighter. "...huuum .,,          aare they.,,,,,,,,,    okay??"

Does she even know this guy's name?? ...signs point to no, and she's got the odd feeling she's not going to learn it anytime soon. 

...that... mildly annoys her. Not him messing up her name, nonono... him messing up her name and turning it into *FUNKO POP.* ".aallcohol.. is   bbad and .,,, kkills people..,  uumm..,,," ...unsure of where to bring that statement, she just trails off.
||.wozwald.||Double D? Ah, yeah. He was there : Hmm ~

Peering at the girl he then spun around with a lopsided head.

Good thing you werent there, most are either drunk. . . Or dead !!!

And just like that he spun on a heel again to face her with a menacing crooked grin, emphasising his point.

Alas, Miss. Thunko-pop, it grew too much for my taste.
||frooztiez||"........uuumm....................                                     hhhhhhhhgiii????" She fully expected him to fucking kill her immediately. And there was a party?? ...she's very slightly saddened that she wasn't invited. She's also mildly relieved that she wasn't invited. Funny how that works.

".gggoood..??                 wasd., dante there??" ...it's dodging a bullet if Dante wasn't there. "...aan.d,, yuum... mnmyy names Theri..,,       not ., thumbtack.."
||.wozwald.||Hm

Turning around : after all the footsteps brought his attention to the door.

Ah  ! Well, if it isnt Miss Thumbtack, you werent at the party but you seem to be doing just fine, how goes your days?
||frooztiez||It is dead no longer! Thimble is here...

...ohhhgg that's her self proclaimed #1 hater in this room mMOOGH..h,, she immediately does her usual trembling, unsure if she should even approach.

However, she doesn't bother leaving the doorway, standing starkly in the center.... so easy to see.,,,,,,,,..
||.wozwald.||Peering in. . . The place truly feels dead when most people are. . Well, at a party currently.
||bellboy||*kali finishes his drinks, gets up, and leaves.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Bless u
||bellboy||*kali sneezes.*
||bellboy||*Kali finished up his craft and sits to enjoy it on his own w no one around to bother him. Just him, his drinks, and the music in the room.*
||bellboy||Dw Kali isn't simple w his alcohol y'all can take that basic shit
||aias_||im sorry his favorite alcohol is currently in use
||bellboy||*teleport... here. Since everyone's gone....he can actually do things he likes ! He starts making a few drinks for himself.*

||frooztiez||Theri watches all of that.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Oh wow. 

If youre all set- were gonna go full set with your consequences Kazuo makes a face, hes trying to be cool dad again. 

Can ya head to that, he points in the cool door citrus was trying to have Dante go into there. 

And please, dont make me tell you again.
||yaoiprincess||If you need anything, please inform me. Asami bows to Citrus then to Kazuo wow her first time doing that. She exits.
||bellboy||*Citrus doesn't care. He pops his leg back on.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I see lots of lips moving but not enough legs and arms.
||yaoiprincess||May I stay? I fear Ill murder my teammate outside.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Dont play dumb games if you dont want dumb prizes bucko, hes dusting his hand a little. Imma ask one more time for you to do those two things.

And then to the audience. And for all yall to please leave before it gets messy.
||yaoiprincess||
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo follows his step, and grabs Dante to judo flip him down (22).
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Oh boy, lemme roll
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I aint gonna wait, Ill start counting.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Nuh-uh, wheres my belt?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Youre gonna head, he looks to Citrus and back, without any apology? Help him back up? Gonna run up there without any bandages? What did Citrus ask you to do?
||yaoiprincess||Asami waits next to Citrus.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo opens the door to face Dante. Yello. He is smiling buthe aint *smiling.* if you get what I mean
||yaoiprincess||`Theres so much rage in that body of hers that it causes her to shake, she resembles an animal waiting for another sign to start attacking.`
||yaoiprincess||`???: 2%`

*Leave me alone.* `Roll perception`
||bellboy||*Citrus stands just fine.* " Now get in or sit down. "
||yaoiprincess||`How nostalgic! She has dear ol dads eyes.`
||bellboy||*Citrus's prostheticless leg pierces into dante's arm.  It seems that that leg latched onto the blade concealed within. (18)*
||yaoiprincess||`???: 1%`

Asami lets go of Citrus and turns to Adiel with a `Roll perception`

FOR ONCE IN OUR MISERABLE LIVES, ***SHUT THE FUCK UP AND DIE ALREADY!!!*** she turns to Dante `Intimidation: 21 for aura`

Put him down!! Now!!
||bellboy||roll dex....
||bellboy||*Citrus is lifted !*

*...*

*His leg did not come with him. He leaves a lone prosthetic leg on the ground.*

" .... "
||yaoiprincess||She hisses at Adiel and tries to pull Citrus down. `Strength: 14`
||yaoiprincess||She tries to jump in front of Citrus but is too slow. `Dex: 15` Do not touch my superior, are you mad!?
||yaoiprincess||DANTE!!
||yaoiprincess||Noble women go to the bathroom on the streets.
||bellboy||" I don't care. Bathroom right here. "
||bellboy||" kill yourself. " *Directed towards adiel without looking at them.* " Come. I will show you to the bathroom here. " *He....opens a cool door.*
||yaoiprincess||She looks so tired.
||yaoiprincess||Just go right here.
||yaoiprincess||Oh my goodness that was amazing. Asami gasps then clears her throat because her trumpet cant see her lacking. Are you saying if we win a dance battle youll stay inside?
||yaoiprincess||I understand but my trumpet will force you to sleep permanently if you leave this room. Dante, I wish to not see you injured.
||yaoiprincess||Dante. Let us dance together in here instead. Shes trying so hard.
||yaoiprincess||Asami blinks and sort of raises an eyebrow. I understand that but my superior wishes for you to sit and he will hurt you if you dont. Please sit down for a moment.
||bellboy||" Sit. " *he demands.*
||yaoiprincess||I dont thats wise right now, theyll hurt you if you attempt to leave. Shes putting her hands up.
||bellboy||" Listen to the woman. Sit. "
||maamthatsafederaloffense||https://tenor.com/view/patroller-patroller-identity-v-patroller-idv-identity-v-idv-gif-1656053490740501203
||yaoiprincess||Asami jumps up a little. Dante, sit back down.
||yaoiprincess||We receive swords if were well behaved? Asami peeks over at Citrus.
||frooztiez||oghgh hi dante....     howw did he not notice her giant ass sword. ".........uhhh//.... ii ve always..,, haddddddd.,,.        stevie.. gave it to me.,,,, because i am.., uuumh,... well      behaved??"
||frooztiez||Theri is here!! She's cleaning her sword in the darkest corner of the room...
<@220287412230815744> u wanted her...... attack...
||bellboy||*paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*paddle pall.*
||bellboy||*Paddle ball.*

*Texting..... paddle ball again.*
||yaoiprincess||Please leave Superior Citrus alone. Asami is playing on her device.
||bellboy||" No. The bar belongs to Kalista. " *He ignores adiel.*
||bellboy||" I work here. " *Paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*paddle baaaall.*
||yaoiprincess||This makes Asami chuckle a bit.
||.wozwald.||Yeah he just needs to reboot
||yaoiprincess||A man almost lost his life.
||yaoiprincess||I believe she had a reason since you bludgeoned our custodian with a computer. Concerned squint.
||yaoiprincess||Im sure hell receive medical attention after his punishment.
||yaoiprincess||Its only an suggestion. Shes still looking at her nails. Youve been injured plenty of times in the past and your trumpet is an understanding woman, I would try to ensure that my health is up to par.
||yaoiprincess||9
||yaoiprincess||Asami rubs her forehead and deeply sighs. No, Im not qualified to check your brain for abnormalities. You need to talk with your trumpet to see the nurse.
||yaoiprincess||Lobotomies are out of fashion. She clicks her tongue. Im suggesting a check for bleeding or abnormalities.
||yaoiprincess||She blinks then raises a brow. You are aware that we have a nurses station yes?
||yaoiprincess||No, it isnt therapy. She shakes her head. Its medical procedures to check for tumors or injuries to your brain.
||yaoiprincess||To be clear, when one has a serious injury they are allowed to see the medical professionals in the building.
||yaoiprincess||Thats not the only method to check ones brain condition and the MRI wasnt invented yet. She checks her nails.
||yaoiprincess||What if its something that can be cured? She swings her legs. Theres many cases of ones behavior changing due to a medical issue.
||yaoiprincess||I figured as such Asami turns her body to face Dante completely. Is it possible that this violence streak of yours isnt a behavioral problem but a health one?
||yaoiprincess||Do you remember the fight entirely? She places her chin in her hands.
||yaoiprincess||She nods along. May I ask you something?
||yaoiprincess||Asami smiles with triumph and goes to sit back down. Only the usual paperwork.
||bellboy||*Citrus....smiles ! He does ! Wow !* " Good. " *Back to paddle baaaaall.*
||yaoiprincess||Asami bows and straightens her posture. Of course, I wont disappoint you.
||bellboy||*Weesper.*
||yaoiprincess||Yes? She does one last stretch and walks over.
||bellboy||" Asami. " *He calls her over.*
||yaoiprincess||Asami is doing leg stretches to save herself the headache.
||bellboy||*yup.*
||bellboy||*citrus...slow blinks. He paddle balls harder. No one knows anyone more baller than him.*
||bellboy||*nah citrus doesn't see that he sees Eraserhead baby. Paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*that's what citrus thinks bros nephew look like.*
||bellboy||*paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*paddle ball.*
||bananices||hey guys
||elainatime||Xavier stumbles out.
||elainatime||He makes a few noises before startling himself awake. His eyes take a moment to process the scene, and for his brain to remember. 

But then his gaze finds its way to Dante and everything clicks back into place.
||elainatime||At some point before Adiel and Citrus came in, Xavier fell asleep sitting on the floor. Now, He stirs.
||yaoiprincess||I understand why our trumpets must be armed but is there a possibility for us to buy weapons to defend ourselves? Asami puts her hand down and sadly faces the music that if Dante or anyone honestly- decided to rampage, she would definitely die first. Its wise to acknowledge your own weaknesses right. I dont believe theres a possibility of me not ending up like Akiara if I was to be in an altercation.
||bellboy||*Citrus wonders why they were hired. He wonders if rhea could just take them off their hand. He looks past his paddle ball and to Asami.* " go on. "
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises a hand. May I ask a question?
||bellboy||*paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*Okay this went from boring to annoying.* " What is he, your pet ? Your baby ? Go get your own food. "
||bellboy||" I have everything I need. " *paddle ball.*
||bellboy||*bounce bounce bounce. paddle ball.*
||bellboy||" I'm here to make sure you go back to sleep if you try something. "
||yaoiprincess||Asami is re-braiding her hair gorjus
||bellboy||*Citrus whips out a paddle ball and starts playing with it in hopes to ignore adiel's kind gestures. Ew.....*
||bellboy||*Citrus rolls his eyes. back to his nails.*
||yaoiprincess||I mean that fact is
||bellboy||" I can't. I am a disabled, trans man. What makes you think I can work anywhere else ? " *He does back to cleaning his nails.....and is interrupted by like....an actual laugh. A real one ! from citrus ! He's never heard a theory so wild ! He's in disbelief !*

 " Oh no ! looks like you've caught us ! " *He acts shocked but the sarcasm bleeds from his otherwise flat and monotone voice.* " Please don't destroy my, what was it ? Simulation ? Reality ? Please remind me I don't think your insane yammering was all too clear. "
||yaoiprincess||Asami is looking around the room to see if theres a gas leak
||yaoiprincess||Vietnam? Asami knows a little bit of history.
||bellboy||*He stifles another snicker.* " I know those backrooms like the back of my hand and yours. Your little suggestion won't do anything but bore me more. "
||bellboy||*Citrus shrugs.* " bored. "
||yaoiprincess||No, I believe thats not allowed Asami hopes not at least.
||bellboy||*Okay that made citrus stifle a dry chuckle.*
||bellboy||*Citrus yawns.*
||yaoiprincess||Asami plays with her hair and taps on her device. Punishment is good for you anyways, it straightens out your bad behavior.
||bellboy||*Citrus cleans his already clean nails.*
||yaoiprincess||You threw a computer at a mans head and severely injured the other. Do you think thats normal? Asami is talking calmly despite this.
||yaoiprincess||`???: It goes up and down`

Asami clenches her jaw until her teeth rattle then slowly eases up.

Thats an ignorant question. It only serves as a weak excuse for ones behavior, you are in control of your path in life and the actions you choose to indulge in will always have consequences. Asami finally lays her eyes onto Dante.

Id stay quiet and take my punishment, allow Mr. Vargas and Akiara to have some justice for your violence.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is resting her head on the table, her eyes arent on Dante completely, shes mostly gazing up at Citrus without saying anything.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Byeee he is trying to play it cool
||bellboy||*Kali bye byeeeee*
||bellboy||" Okay. " *He stands near dante, leaning against the wall.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Yeah- especially since Kali took my favorite terminal to the head he does a little with but he looks very happy to see Citrus, despite him looking a bit worked. He keeps looking at him and then he pats his pockets. Ok, well I got to take care of Kali, so Ill see you later. 

He is scoooping up Kali.
||starzono||Man is going to skedaddle. He doesn't want to mess with all this <3
||bellboy||*teleport citrus here. he stands and stares.*

"..."

*He breathes out a mild chuckle.* " Seems he's given you...*and him* quite the work out. " *He goes to readjust Kazuo's ascot.* " And Stevie finished the job....for the most part. "

<@305913481113239552>
||starzono||Alright! So! After everything he would have returned with the Fellas a while ago, but oh god. This room sure is something huh.
He just. Wow. No words for this.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo pushes Adiel, gently off. Dont do that again. Okie dokie?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Not me~
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Probably because he doesnt have it?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||HDHDHSHDJDJDHHDH
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Im not gonna ask if thats possible, and Id like you to rephrase that first bit for me.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Well I was going to have a chat with Citrus actually. He says very matter of fact. Ive been in my neck with all this it would be nice.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks at Kazuo as if theyre in the office together
||bananices||Etienne kind of wants a drink too but they don't know if they have to be more homoerotic about it.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Dont make it sound so intimate, he snorts
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Not until these people get out~
||maamthatsafederaloffense||locked
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Once I get a chance to go in there myself. But again..." he gestures vaguely, "plans halted until further notice."
||bananices||KAZUO PONY
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Well...not all the switches are out yet. And I can't check right now because my favorite terminal was  used as a blunt force weapon. So...sorry."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||probably
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yeah, because he hurt...more than one person with some...vicousness? Self defense." And as for Mirai, "You can keep the one over there, but use for the exploration, we don't want to run out."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"He needs to be dealt with by some other authorities, so let's not bother him for now," again with a sweet smile. "And that's a very fair question to ask. We're trying to get them accomodated for now."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Don't bother~" C;
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Nope!" C: < he smiles like this
||yaoiprincess||Asami cringes. Gay ass.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"...Dante went crazy on Yuumi, Yuumi egged him on, Yuumi got knocked out, Kali and I interved, Kali got knocked out, Stevie and I intervened, and now he's...temporarily  restrained until I figure out how to get him away. That is the short end of it. How was your expenduture? Keep talking, I have to get ahold of someone," he tapping on his device, "His name starts with a C~"
||yaoiprincess||Asami opens her mouth then remembers last time she talked to Kazuo she had to watch the wall dry she simply waves to him and sits down.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo waves hello
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo's a lil zoned, "Huh- oh, y'ello, what did you need?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||he's like right next to him bro i really wouldnt
||maamthatsafederaloffense||sorry i didnt mean to yell
||maamthatsafederaloffense||NO
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo still here, puppy guarding Kali.
||.wozwald.||Forcing out a laugh, head to the side really to let that hand rest on his shoulder before it had moved off - No denying that. "The will shall carry on then - Thank you for entertaining my questions, I'll leave you be~ Mister. Kali should be fine. . . I can assure you that much."

With that he slinked off. To be awake or asleep - In what seems endless, who knows for certain. And what is truly real. Device out, sending a message somewhere.  "Au revoir , chairman." <:walk:655662861908967435>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Well, its a common response to trauma to not be able to identify reality, he does a pinching motion, but I can assure youre awake. He puts his hands down. 

But I suppose you have a point; namely that you cant stop in the midst of death, he gives Natsume a little pat on the shoulder.
||.wozwald.||Maybe it is just all an act - A show . . . Made to fit the pretence of an experiment disguised : Kazuo's answers don't particularly phase him but are enough to leave a little impression, looking back over at the mad-man Dante who peacefully slumbered at this point, rubbing his head - Hat off the moment he could for a quick second.

"From the sounds of it - Convenient or not , you aren't aware of more people being around ; But you're dedicated to the role of chairman that playing it off . . *Comes natural.*" 

One more thing. . . Now here's the kicker, siding another little look towards the chairman with regards to what muscle man was spouting earlier. " . . . Maybe I'm just a little sick, so calling into work today won't be convenient for me. . Yet I'm starting to wonder : If any of this is *real.*" A simulation, where the trumpets are casually assigned roles as fictional characters and that's why in situations like these , all that can be done is - Well the case of averaged out work actions.
||.wozwald.||<:soubothered:1006246651477889044>
||.wozwald.||"We'll call it termination then."

Bowing , as a sign of appreciation for answering the prior questions. "To reiterate, termination : Death, I'm sure you've had an earful from Miss. Baeyo already that Miss. Akiko has died." Shoulders raised to a natural shrug. "If you don't intend on elaborating further than what you already have, then it probably doesn't matter in the long run. . . Discarded , and frankly : Forgotten." A cold way to phrase it but since she was one of the few he had the misfortune of never speaking to : Opinions on the life of a living ghost are nil to him.  <a:blackrose:1004750445236985917> 

To the man it was akin to a flower withering, one dies and another grows in its place... Those that go missing wither from memory, and are eventually to be replaced to. Though through the wording he pondered if Kazuo really was aware of more people being in the place , or if this was part of the act of keeping the Hotel Charade up... "Death is a little more than just. . . *Death.* In a place like this , especially. But through the gaze of an overseer, it doesn't amount to much: One dies, and fortunately, fate wishes for things to continue running without issue."
||frooztiez||Theri thinks she's here? idk i wasnt here
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo doesnt seem to be overwhelmed with them, he gives it ample consideration. Heres the big three points, he uses his thumb,pointer and middle finger. 

One, is it really smart to try disarm a guy kinda known to just go berserk that by yourself? I already tousled, toe to toe and frankly, I dont want to especially on short notice. And, just an off point, he adjusts his seat and gives Natsume a really judgy look, Bud, I know you all like to watch that, but I hardly doubt it for those two ladies. 

He leans back, Which brings me to, Two. Call it convenient, or what not but after what happened with Baeyo and Akiko, Ive had my plate full trying to make sure things are running smoothly. If theres new people here somehow then so be it. At least theyre not going to be stuck in there anymore. And last- third, what did you mean by that? That last bit? Death is usually, and hear me out, just death?
||.wozwald.||"The need for more people - I'm referring to those two we found : And if there's anymore."

Casually playing with the flashlight in hand : Observing how the other went about treating the injured, of course with nothing else to establish the idea of it being true: Opted to speak up. "The missing co-workers that were among us , and you asking us to flip these switches seemed oddly convenient in tune to finding these other variables - So I wondered if this was all planned in case we lost a few faces."

   Dancing between the digits now, the torch only remained turned off.

"I don't think you had any intent on stepping in : It was just until Mister. Kali got involved did you make a move , so had Mister. D'Agostino went further, and let's say. . . Death were to happen by the hands of our own comrade ; That was also an innate possibility you were prepared for." Such if that were the case, Soseki could only reason a few more things... Stopped beating around the bush. "So. . . Let me ask : What is the true meaning of death, in a workspace like this?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Whats your question? He asks, adjusting Kali so he is a bit more comfortable.
||.wozwald.||Looks like the entertainment sector of that event has died down ~ In assuming that therell be some more down the line because of this . . It wont be long until everyone else hears of this.

   Looking over to Kazuo with a raised brow hes moved over to where Kali is as well.

You good to answer a few questions in the meantime, chairman? More-so to clear the air if anything~
||elainatime||Xavier still sitting. Looking far away. He is within Dantes line of sight when he comes to.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kali is getting adjusted, put on the bed for now...damn...
||pulsatilla||<:awwww:1158234237296709684> Carried
||sadpastry||Thank you, Kazuo. I shall be back. She carries Yuumi away!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I'll have a phone on standby."
||pulsatilla||"...Do...l-let me know when he's up..." He finally tears his eyes away, now squeezing them shut. Ugh. What a day.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"...He'll be looked at."
||pulsatilla||Yuumi's staring at Kali's unconscious body still.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo liked that answer. 

"I'll try to reach out to the other groups and people to tell them to pull back before it gets late." He stands to look at Yuumi.
||sadpastry||Oh! She looks at the wall and takes it in. Oh, thank you. It is just my job.

Alrighty, well, if that was it Callista room time.?<:smilesmile:1216153881457983700>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He flashes her a quick smile, "I marked it down," he points to the wall, the southern most one is crossed out. "I appreciate it.
||sadpastry||I know, I am sorry. Um.. Hopefully, my success of flipping one kill switch brings a bit of ease to you. If the chairman says hes good, hes good.

Callista scoops up Yuumi like a little princess! I am ready when you are, sir.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I'm fine, I'm the chairman, remember?" He stretches a little, "Though I have to say, there are some people that do make this much harder than it has to be."
||sadpastry||Are you sure you are okay with helping? I am sorry.
||sadpastry||Thank you, but I am.. not hungry. She has since lost her appetite.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"...In a minute, I can do it, you should eat something," he rubs his chin,  thinking thoughts.
||sadpastry||.. She nods. Sir, do I have permission to get these two to an actual bed? <@305913481113239552>
||sadpastry||She whispers back.
||pulsatilla||He pulls her closer, managing nothing but a whisper to her ear.
||sadpastry||That is fair. I shall be here, ready to tend to him if thats what needs to happen. She keeps picking up things and throwing them in a nearby trashcan. Shes helping, she swears.

Yuumi catches her attention, Oh, *thank goodness.* Your face is.. Natsume and I looked after you. She kneels down to him, How are you? Are you feeling better? How can I help? Im so sorry. <@162025912227987457>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just lets out another groan, too much to think about. He opens his eye to look around at his surroundings, coming to a halt to Kali who's- wow... also laid the fuck out. He reaches out to... gently smack Kali's face, before he settles back to just laying like a wet carpet on the floor. Belugh.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo deciding, "Well...Stevie needs to cool off first. Then she can say what needs to happen. Though, I suppose Mr. Vargas, if and when he gets up can input something, perhaps Mr. Akiara too."
||bellboy||*Zzzzzzzzzzz*
||pulsatilla||Yuumi... Yuumi awakens. His eyes flutter open, but- he lets out a groan, hands flying up to clutch at his face, full of bruises and stinging pain. He's not getting up from the floor, shit too comfy.
||sadpastry||Callista expected as much. Should I not tend to his wounds first? She stands up and dusts off her skirt, Do not mistake my question for insubordination, I am just.. Well, nevermind. You have your plans for him, I suppose.

She awkwardly shuffles over to the terminal that was used as a weapon first. Cleaning up anything around it, doing what she can for the floor. Standard stuff.
||.wozwald.||(( Soseki shall autopilot for I shall snooze
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"He's going to face...very harsh consequences. Alone." He looks over to Dante. "But good, help me pick up the room, they're not going any where for a second." He fixes his clothes and takes another sigh.
||sadpastry||She pats Natsumes shoulder. She says nothing though, just smiling warmly.

Back to Kazuo though! Yuumi was only handling a broken nose at most, with bruising already coming in. However, I can assure you that Natsume and I have handled them with the supplies provided to the best of our abilities. They shall be okay.
||.wozwald.||"Mister. Kali. . . It's mostly head injuries , but nothing life threatening from simple looks but still I recommend keeping an eye on him : It's Mister. Yuumi that is certainly handling it worse."

Glancing over to the job that had been done, crossing one leg over the other. "What's your plan with Mister. D'Agostino from here on out? I doubt this'll be overlooked as a minor incident."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"How bad are Yuumi and Mr. Vargas's injuries?"
||.wozwald.||*"I feel nothing from it - But I feel life will be a little easier now I have."*
||sadpastry||*I certainly hope not.. Are you glad you put those items back now?*
||.wozwald.||*"You think we're gonna get punched next. . . ?"*
||bellboy||*Stevie stomps out. Huff !*
||sadpastry||*Helloooo*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ahem."
||.wozwald.||<:ocursedinnocent2:894105548851642389>
||sadpastry||<:guh:1215925734640582666>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Take a bath while you're at it honey bunch." Kazuo flashes her a smile and back to everyone else. He's just gonna drag Dante to a nearby solid pole, and fastens the handcuffs there. 
now to these other three....
||sadpastry||And Im happy I have such influence. You flatter me. Now her smiles a little warmer. Playful, but visibly fond of him.

And then *damn.* I was just about to say that! Shes so.. Wow! Just wow. She nods approvingly.
||.wozwald.||". . She's scary, isn't she?"

Whispering to Callista. <:STARE:1072608269543149650>
||bellboy||*She's still angry but takes in some deep breaths, blowing her hair out of her face in the process. she looks at kazuo...* " Am I good to go back ? "
||sadpastry||He can wait. She looks at Stevie.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I'm alright but...Ahem." Kazuo is clearing his throat.
||elainatime||Xavier slides his back down the wall behind him, landing on his butt. Hes looking vaguely at the scene in front of him.
||.wozwald.||"It's because you asked. . . Otherwise it would not have changed the outcome."

Joking lightly , with a tinge of seriousness. Returning to his care on Kali, well after having gone through what was asked in dms, but other than that, given the current turn of events.

"I wonder if we'll be getting a zoo as the next open-area. . ."
||sadpastry||Callista laughs weakly when he apologizes to the unconscious man and slips the cent into his shoe. Thank you. Really, I would hate for you to deal with what Ive seen. *Dear.* It feels nice, joking in the face of.. well, you know.

And then it was quiet. She turns her head to what used to be the fight and just.. sighs with relief, seeing that Dantes knocked out. *Lucky.* She wont elaborate, he knows what she means.

Um.. If you two need medical attention, please come over here Thank you for diffusing that, *thank you..* Calling attention to the Trumpets.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(14) he goes down...but if he's down here... he goes to swing but- oh Dante's out.

He's going to sit on Dante's back and use his belt as a makeshift handcuffs. 

"What a pleasant afternoon."
||.wozwald.||https://tenor.com/view/stewie-griffin-family-guy-falling-down-stairs-gif-22788721
||.wozwald.||Be happy that Soseki is a merciful man. Stolen keys have been returned.... But he is checking the wallet one more time...  Gonna dm just out of curiosity and not to take up chat space
||bellboy||*Kali sleep. face down. body limp.*
||.wozwald.||He's tucked it into Kali's shoe
||.wozwald.||". . . Hm? Ah - Yes stolen items."

Debating it for a second, he'll return the keys for the time being. "I suppose it's best to leave them, I won't fight for something like that."  Choosing to relinquish the keys back to the owner, flashlight on the other hand will be kept.

"My bad, dear Callista ~"

Focus returning on the potentially bleeding head, using the wrap to bandage the others head. "And I'm sorry Mister. Kali for stealing your house keys."

Returning that singular cent, but not to the wallet.
||bellboy||*Stevie's anger continues on. To all that have watched dante lose it, stevie's state is nothing short of familiar. She's in charge of dante for a reason.*

*She throws sense less punches at Dante. (22,10,24) She aims to put him to sleep, but fortunately she has more control than him and makes sure it's not eternal.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||we gonna let stevie fo
||maamthatsafederaloffense||oop
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Well, Kazuo;s just been guarding...and now Stevie is pissed...
Walk away to get Natsume, Kali, Callista and Yuumi outta here, but...
He is about to walk away, but, just for a free kick lick (11)
||sadpastry||Callista PUUULLLS on Yuumi, trying to keep fixing him up even now that Dantes on his ass. She shield his body with hers actually, continuing her work!

And then shes registering what Yuumis doing. You should at least put the keys back. I do not want you to get horribly punished for something so silly.
||.wozwald.||Roblox roleplay moment
||bellboy||*She manages to dodge that punch (16)*

# **" TRY HARDER, HUH ? I'LL SHOW YOU HARDER ! "**

*She growls, pink eyes red with anger (9)*

 *She throws a clean punch at Dante (25).*
||.wozwald.||". . . Huh ~ Interesting." Playing around with the idea, there's something to take away but with the potential of it being a fake ID... He'll return it for now, take a singular cent. 

The keys and flashlight are being kept though. Former stuffed carefully away in his pockets "Turns out he does not have anything useful. . . But a flashlight, could smash it on ol' stompy's head and knock him out that way."
||bellboy||02/14/1941
||.wozwald.||Does the ID also have a birth date on? Proof of the man being alive after 1969
||bellboy||ID. 20 usd. a few photos of people he cares about bc he's a normal guy who happens to have like a family. 26 cents usd. like a coupon to some grocery store. its a painfully normal wallet dude.
||.wozwald.||<@242165436731359232> What's inside that wallet. . .  He'll return it after checking.
||.wozwald.||What a useless janitor.... 

Y'know what out of spite, he's also taking that wallet.
||bellboy||no bro hes a fucking janitor....
||.wozwald.|| He's going to take the keys and the flashlight. 

But man does bro have no weapon? Not even a taser-
||bellboy||useless shit like paper, keys, a pen, holy shit....a flashlight ! uh....more paper. a wallet ?
||.wozwald.||"Just keep calm, lil lass ~ Their lives are dependent on you  "

Words of encouragement whislt he's pickpocketing a trumpet.
||sadpastry||I shall finish fixing Yuumi, then. She crawls over to fill where Natsume used to be after securing her work on Kali. Her hands have to keep moving.
||.wozwald.||"There's no need. . . Let's have a look, shall we? There might be a means to help"

In the midst of the fighting, Soseki is going to rummage through Kali's pockets to see if there's a weapon or something of *importance* that's being kept. <@242165436731359232>
||bellboy||*Stevie briefly freezes from kazuo taking the punch but goes ahead and tries to uppercut this dude. Shoryuken ! (17)*
||sadpastry||Thats.. precisely what I intend. As shocking as it is, you are correct. It is a necessary evil. Theres a wild look in her eyes. And if I do suffer for it, so be it. He shall regret it when hes.. back to normal. He just needs to stop.

Alas, Kalistas head comes first. Shes bandaging it fully now and making sure that shes not sacrificing the quality of her work for the sake of speed.
||elainatime||Dante. Xavier croaks out. His eyes are glazed over but fixed to the scene in front of him.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(19) Kazuo steps in the way taking that for Stevie. lemme roll now to hurt u dante
||.wozwald.||"I wouldn't recommend it. . . He's blinded by rage - You'll end up suffering just as much, then you're useless if you can't provide aid to those."

   Grumbling, shaking his head- snapping his fingers.

"Unless you intend on using *that* to subdue him~ That'll be quite a surprise." Eying the fighting happening to the side, Dante hitting a woman was undoubtedly not on his bucket list. And there they go... "It might be a necessary evil, my friend."
||pulsatilla||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK1_NFT5crk
||maamthatsafederaloffense||their knuckles graze, but dante's lands, tho it's like that.
||sadpastry||Shes officially locking in to help her friends medically while also trying to keep an eye on the fight. We just have to We have to work quickly so that we can be ready to cover all of these bodies, but if one more person drops, I I am going in. She gives him a knowing look.

But for now, we are here. Shes cleaning Kalistas possible head wound and quickly wrapping it with bandages. Glancing up at the fight hurriedly.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo tanks that (18) and then kicks again, (16).
||bellboy||*Fuck bro. no one dodges stevie. She's shocked by it, having her next punch be a lot weaker. (12)* " shit- "
||elainatime||Xaviers breath catches in his throat. He cant quite contort his mouth to make words, but the sound still escapes him in a low groan.
||.wozwald.||". . He's alive- Shockingly. Guess people can't die twice." Muttering, he's dragged the poor man over to where Callista dragged Kali, leaving Kazuo who finally learnt how to play streetfighter. "We'll probably have a lot of bodies to deal with."

 . . . Considering the pain they're all in.
An amused yet deprecating chuckle from the masked man.

"Another joins the fray it seems~" Stevie bounding into the room. That caught his eye, only to take the injured Yuumi, beginning by wiping any blood that's on his face.
||aias_||https://tenor.com/view/jojos-bizarre-adventure-milton-jojo-kicking-fight-gif-16647809
||bellboy||*Okay so Stevie shows up. She glares at dante with a natural anger looming over her. She joins kazuo with a solid falcon punch (22)*
||sadpastry||CALLISTA IS SO GRATEFUL SOSEKI. Thank you, *thank you* And then shes gonna tend to their injuries on the floor, taking little tissues or gauze or something to swipe her tears away before working on them.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Well...there goes Kali, 
(23) Roundhouse kick again in the gut.
||pulsatilla||<a:cat_dead:1116513411753320530>
||elainatime||Xavier is paralyzed. Still staring.
||.wozwald.||If she's doing that. . . He's going to attempt to drag Yuumi away, assuming he was dropped on the floor. <:STARE:1072608269543149650> Sooooo how's your evening tonight, yuumster?
||sadpastry||Callista immediately goes to drag Kalista away from the fight, crying due to the overwhelming guilt of having called him here.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kali....
||.wozwald.||You know what. . . Crouching down : He's just going to casually poke Kali who's down.

"Don't tell me that's all it takes to knock you down. . . Go on, I know that ain't all you got."
||bellboy||*kali down fly high*
||.wozwald.||<:RPGMarioSip:641080396091621376> . . . What a peaceful resolution.
He is spectating all of this, no longer trying to stop anything.

"Kaboom to that . . "
||.wozwald.||Oh.
||.wozwald.||<:presidentstand:1129369465042251936>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(18) And Kazuo's just gonna give a good ol kick to the side too on Dante.
||bellboy||*Cool. Kali runs towards the two and does his best to repeat what had happened last time. (15) punch to the face.*
||.wozwald.||"*Violent. . . ~*"
||sadpastry||DANTE, *PLEASE.* Oh thank GOD. The sobbing Callista looks at her name twin and automatically is filled with relief. Shes popping open the medkits through the tears. Ready to recieve Yuumi!
||pulsatilla||"*F-FUCK YOU--*" He chokes out.
||.wozwald.||He is but a bystander-
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"After you." he exhales a breath. 

ok so kali, then me then dante and if yuumi awake
||bellboy||<@305913481113239552>
||bellboy||*Kali runs in and sees this shit holy fuck. His eyes dart between kazuo and the fight. Dude...dude ??? He smiles a pained smile, letting him know he's about to jump in no matter what he does.*
||pulsatilla||`STAMINA - 1`  As blood trickles from his nose, a result of the flurry of punches, Yuumi's bite has also drawn blood from his tongue- causing him to choke, gag, struggle to keep himself awake- *alive.*
||elainatime||Xavier retreats, unable to take his eyes off whats happening in front of him. He just backs up against the wall, petrified.
||.wozwald.||"I'm *suuuure* they'll be plentiful."

Just trying to keep the prying - From prying even worse. Can only guess on who's coming, still not accosting the chairman much of a huff.
||sadpastry||I contacted more help. She chokes out. `STR 10` Perhaps it was Natsumes aid that helped her get a little more strength, but she just pats Natsumes back and rushes for the medical supplies in tears. Grabbing multiple kits and rushing back!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"5...4...3..."
||.wozwald.||<:TDM_secret:1217270004630945863> As bad as this looks . . . There's no intent on stepping in : All plays out for a reason , emotions unfettered are par to the course, even if violent. Brutish, primitive. Humanity in its rawest, the environment had become a little more stagnant, if not tense...
  `. . .`
"Seems our Chairman has no intent on stepping in either." Casting Kazuo a quick glance, it was a pity, really. Again, this affirms as much, test subjects don't need the likes of the ones testing on them to interfere. This was just as much a controlled experiment as any.... So many factors. If on cue though, Soseki is only neutral even once Callista gets involved.

   || Just the same as ever. . . Huh M-||

"Fine , fine ~ You heard the lil lass, let's put an end to this."

Providing miniscule backup to the nurse, using `12` of his strength to support the other in prying them apart, tugging at Dante's other shoulders, though it proves physically pointless, something he already saw happening. . . But cant say he didn't try.
||sadpastry||Callista is shaking slightly, it wasnt exactly hard to see that but shes the type to put on a brave face. Shes pale, and the pride behind her most recent victory has already fleeted. It was shortlived, because *look what fucking happened.*

Oh my God, *oh my GOD, STOP* My strength roll was an `8` to try and split them up so Callista jumping up and tugging at Dantes shoulders behind him does virtually nothing. Her eyes immediately well with tears, and soft sobs threaten to burst from her ribs.

*STOP IT ALREADY* I Shes sniffling as she pulls out her device. Idea!
||pulsatilla||`STAMINA - 11` He remains awake, which probably is... a not so good thing!

He can't reply back, Yuumi just continues to struggle and defend himself from the punches. `DEX - 12` He's really failing against this...
||.wozwald.||"And there they go. . . Missing the fun as it only increases."

Mumbling haphazardly waving the two off- Its ok , he'll spill whatever tea there is later on. 
||kyunu||*Aw, and they were getting to the good part... She sighs, brushing her hair out of her face.*
 "Alright then.~" *Hinoki looks to Tiffany, pulling her along to the lobby, if she's going to follow...*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Miss Mu, Miss Singh? If you go into the lobby, theres a bellhop there. Just explain who you are, and hell help you out. As for the two of them, I dont want you to watch. 
<@131145091178954752> <@161652713359147009>
||elainatime||Xavier hesitates for a moment, and then backs away.
||.wozwald.||<:ocursedinnocent2:894105548851642389> Well, well, well.
||pulsatilla||`STAMINA - 15 [NAT 20]`

Yuumi's breath catches in a wheeze as he feels the impact of his back against the unforgiving wall. Despite the pain surging through him, he pushes it aside, focusing solely on Dante. His face remains impassive, an impenetrable mask of indifference and disdain. **Uncaring**.

"You meant something to someone, and yet, look at what you've put them through," he scoffs, his voice laced with disappointment and simmering anger. With desperate determination, Yuumi claws at Dante's hands, attempting to pry himself free from the grip that binds him. "I trusted you, I believed in you time and time again, you've only let me down. What's humorous is you're aware of your destructive tendencies, yet you refuse to break free from this cycle. Ah, but consciousness is a curse in disguise, no? Instead, you revel in chaos and destruction. You weep and beg for forgiveness after- yet I'm s-sorry to say, Dante, I have no interest in forgiving. You can go to Hell with that knowledge, while I sleep soundly tonight, **unbothered**."

`STRENGTH - -2` 

Despite his feeble attempts, Yuumi extends his trembling hands toward Dante's face, a futile gesture of defiance. Weak and frail compared to Dante's imposing presence, he still struggles to assert himself. "You'll never change, will you? Tell me what have you done to earn even a shred of my empathy? Name *one* instance that doesn't involve *her* name." His voice rises, dripping with venomous fury. "You *never* respected me, *never* treated me as my own person, *never* cared to *learn*. You only sought my approval, as if I were your mentor. But now, I see you for what you truly are a *pest*, a blight upon us all. Perhaps *he* saw you as the same."

"I was *willing* to see what everyone else sees in you- willing to change- but you're *impatient.* It doesn't happen overnight, it doesn't happen with *one* conversation."

He tilts his head back, licking up a wad of spit inside his mouth to shoot out and hit Dante with square in the face. "Do me a favor, and put a bullet between your eyes."
||.wozwald.||"Ahh - Wish to go back to venturing then?"

Stepping back, there isn't a bad idea there. "Shall we continue deeper into the rooms then - We might find more switches, plus a deeper investigation is always a bit of fun." Not opposed to the idea, uncaring to those that are too much suffering right now.

"Whatever happens , happens - There's a little fun to a mystery ahead."
||sadpastry||*Thank you..* Her voice is.. faint, sad. While she wants to help Dante and Yuumi out, she was painfully aware that the only place she could help out was in the aftermath.

I just want to.. keep going at this point. She tries not to lower her head too much, or even her arms, as to not disrupt the wrapping of bandages. Shell just reflect sad wet cat energy until Natsumes all wrapped up, dead fish eyes glancing down at the floor.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||turn off computer...
He's gonna stand between those two and everyone else + new people,,,
||kyunu||*It's becoming difficult to ignore the chaos happening nearby. Though, she tilts her head over to watch for a moment.* "... What a commotion.~"
||.wozwald.||New people... More switches, if it's formulaic , then the masked man is assuming there's more people trapped with more unending horrors. "My ~ This case is worrying."
||.wozwald.||<:souhmmmm:1006363531752513567>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo moves a little towards Dante and Yuumi afterwards, just giving them a loook.
||.wozwald.||"Huh - Never mind , a complete change in the storyline has left an impact on another~"

Commenting, watching at the whole fight went down- Still undeterred however, wrapping the bluette's head in the mean time. One can only observe, and not interfere. "It was bound to happen eventually. . . *Eventually.*"

There's just a wrapping motion, until it had been tight around. "I think. . . That's much better."  No intent on getting involved with yuumi and dante's scuffle. "I'll give you a proper check-over when everything's died down : I do have qualifications as a doctor after all."
||elainatime||Dante, *stop*! Xavier rushes over and smacks his shoulder, trying to get him to drop Yuumi.
||sadpastry||Then I shall let you give them a better look over, but it can wait. Have you forgotten I am a nurse? Her tones playful. It was nice to finally let her heart *finally* stop the hammering with the stress of what happened.  What she had to do. Does she regret pulling the switch though? Nope!

In fact, there was more to do. More people to save. There is more, judging from the pamplet. We need to fix all of the switches so no one else dies as a result of the backrooms, and I intend to check out every last one that I can.

She lifts up her gloved hands to take out her hair buns, letting her blue locks free. Wrap me swiftly, please. The two newcomers are doing fine

Oh, Dante and Yuumi. *Fantastic.* Callista is frozen in her place, wide eyed and staring. Her lips press together in a thin line.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Hinoki Mu and Tiffany Singh." He repeats, and he types on his computer, reads, clicks somethings and closes it.
||kyunu||"Are you saying you're our boss? In which case, if this were our first day, hypothetically- I'm sure you'd know our names for orientation at the least.~ In an ordinary situation, we'd submit little resumes to you and you'd be well aware of us." *She smiles at him. All smiles here.* 

 "Of course, I could introduce myself, but your inquiry of our names simply seemed quite funny considering the situation. What I say, is in jest- I hope you don't mind me having fun in dire circumstances. Regardless, it's a pleasure to meet you, I am Hinoki Mu." *She giggles.*
||.wozwald.||"If that's what you think then - I don't have an issue remaining here but I still have some concerns. . I do worry for our new companions, they'll probably be taking it harder than any of us."

Counting on his fingers. . . One - Two. "Likely there's more as well , so I assume the kill switch situation hasn't completely ended yet : We've only covered so much ground, you must've heard the sounds that the other switch made. . . We likely unlocked a new road." Listing of potentials, then with a raise of the arm.

"Aha~ It's such a predicament. . .  Well to be frank I also want to give those wounds a proper look.. Chances of infections especially from closed spaces like so are bound to happen."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I mean I've heard different ways to call a boss for your 9-5, but I love to be pioneer," he laughs a little, dry, then returns to the gravity of the situation. He pinches his nose and then drags his hand across his face as he sighs.
||sadpastry||She puts her device away, focusing on her friend. Yuumi is the best option to act as an ambassador for the newcomers, I agree with that. And my injuries are not so bad that they require immediate attention, so we do not.. *have* to go to one of our rooms.

Even then, she trails off thinking. My original plan was to wrap my shoulders wound temporarily, and then ask for further instructions since there seemed to be multiple kill switches, but I shall follow your lead. Yet the new information she just saw was alarming. She looked down, and then back up. What do you think, Natsume?
||elainatime||Xavier deflates a little bit.
||kyunu||*Hinoki can't help but laugh a bit when he asks for their names.* "Are you saying that you don't already know our names? I figured that since we were brought here, you would have already known.~"

*She sighs lightly.* "Based on what the others have said, you are our 'captor,' after all."
||pulsatilla||Yuumi looks at Dante, brows furrowing. "We are taking you seriously, however there is only so much *we* can do. Most of us are still dazed from the building collapsing in, and we are still addressing the new people."

He crosses his arms together, annoyed. "There's a lot happening at once, apologies if we can't put all the attention onto one thing. But don't go and say that we aren't taking this *seriously.*"
||.wozwald.||"It'll be a help, though I can also fix this all up back at one of the hotel rooms : I think the amount of people here is also a concern to the two new faces."

Glancing back over at them. "If anything I believe leaving them to Mister. Yuumi is likely the best result , any information he gleams we can get from him later ~ Though whilst I'm interested in the personal reactions of unknown denominators, there'll be chances to see them in action later on. So if you wish to head back , that's also an option."
||pulsatilla||Wait b4 he leaves the channel-
||elainatime||to see how bad xaviers feelings are hurt
||sadpastry||She slowly pulls out her device for a second. Looking back at Yuumi, typing something very quickly, looking at Dante, then finally back at Natsume.

Um. Whichever you prefer. I can take out my hair buns if that would help you.
||elainatime||roll strength on the slap? :D
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Hinoki, Hinoki last name?" he addresses her, then to Tiffany, "And your name as well? Again, I don't know if they made mention, but I'm Kazuo Nishiji, I'm the Chairman." He takes a deep breath. "And...I am sure there is a great deal of thing that happened just now, but for these two's sake. If you don't want to discuss things right now, you're dismissed."
||elainatime||Xavier doesnt notice. `[Perception: -2]` He just grabs a napkin and tries to wipe the grease off of Dantes face.
||pulsatilla||He looks at her, and then at Natsume, then back to her.
||.wozwald.||"Want me to swap those bandages as well then? Might as well do the whole lot."

Taking the first aid supplies that Callista had. "It's fine Mister. Yuumi, changing bandages isn't hard so I can get this done, *rather* quickly." Focus back on the nurse- Even they get hurt at times. "Head or shoulders first?"
||sadpastry||In my hotel room, I shall. I promise! She pauses. Although, I am sure that Natsume will do a perfectly good job. Do not fret, my friend.
||elainatime||.My bad. Im Im sorry dude..
||pulsatilla||"Do treat yourself soon."
||pulsatilla||"...Good point." 
||elainatime||YOU CAN HAVE BOTH! Xavier tries to shove it into his mouth `[STR: -1 (nat 1)]` but fails horribly, just smearing hotdog on his face.
.
||sadpastry||I can not remove my shirt here to properly fix myself. She gives Yuumi a knowing look.
||kyunu||*Hinoki's eyes narrow as she stares at the man, but appears to be calm. She's blocking out some of what the others are saying at this point.* "I'm fine, thank you.~" *She hums, looking to Tiffany. Her voice is soft, and her eyes trace over her to confirm...* 

"I don't believe you're injured either, yes?" <@161652713359147009>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just... walks back to the group, looking at Callista. "There's firstaid on the table, tend to yourself."
||sadpastry||Callista opens her mouth to respond to Dante, but she looks up at Natsume instead. Eyes a little wide, and shes still a bit breathless.

Oh! Oh, um.. sure. Thank you, that would be very nice. My head wound may bleed at some point or another as well, but I think that.. it will be okay for now.
||elainatime||YEAH! Try this fucking- Piggy!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||ok....
||elainatime||Oh, shut the fuck up dante. Xavier tries to put a pig in a blanket into his mouth.
||pulsatilla||He's taking the grilled broccolini and putting it into his pockets.
||.wozwald.||"Do you need someone to wrap your shoulder?"

Might as well do so whilst everyone else is in their tweak era. "It can at least be a better job than a temporary one - How about it, friend?"
||elainatime||Ths are, mmm, wike, reawwy goog
||maamthatsafederaloffense||grilled broccolini, crackers, uhm yuumi name a food u like there's like that
||sadpastry||Callista merely nods when Kazuo says his thanks, deciding to wrap her injured shoulder up.. over her uniform. Temporary solution. Shes looking at Dante with a deep frown, letting her panic stay internal.
||elainatime||Wmt th ffg? Its muffled because his mouf is full.
||pulsatilla||What vegetarian options are there <:smilesmile:1216153881457983700>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||its REALLY GOOD.
||elainatime||Xavier shovels pig in a blanket into his mouth.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||yes
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo, a 5'10" man in similar work clothes, but with a nice orange ascot and long black glove that covers his left arm. 

He stands as he looks over everyone coming in. First...he looks at every one, traces his finger on the terminal screen, then marks something off of the glass wall. He then looks at the new peopl and puts on his glasses. 

"Oh- well I be," he doesn't frown but his face is in a struggle for being a pleasant smile to immediate concern. "Thank you for bringing them in."

"Are you unharmed?" he addresses the two new people firmly, then to the others. "I need to know that first, before I need you all to sit down and take a second. Understand?"
||kyunu||*Hinoki looks at the man in front of her- but doesn't say anything. She listens to the others in the group first.*
||.wozwald.||"This should be interesting. . .  "

Commenting to himself, he's trying to register the fact he was treated like a sack of potato's. There's no saying much else, just opting to listen in, he was part of the group and feels like he should be privy to such information.

"I doubt we'll get anything about the whole disappearing situation - But the more important assets are the unknown people we've run into."
||elainatime||is there chicken tenders and/or pigs in a blanket
||sadpastry||See? She points to Dante. *Questions.* Callista decides to help herself to medical supplies.
||pulsatilla||Teleporting. <@131145091178954752> <@161652713359147009> Yuumi guides them here!
||elainatime||we in here
||sadpastry||Teleporting here! Callista walks in, a dazed but kind of.. blank expression. Is she still proud as hell though? *Yes.*

Hello, um.. sir. I have triggered a kill switch and saved a room from being collapsed. Two women were in the room as well, and there are more people coming with a lot of questions.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Adjacent to the bar is Kazuo working away, wiping away and writing things on a glass board about different things, referring to his terminal when needed. There's a good assortment of first aid supplies here as well as some finger foods and bottled waters. Towels, spare clothes, u name it, he probably has it on deck.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``` ```
||yaoiprincess||The apology isnt acknowledged. Asami finishes up her bowl of ramen without giving Soraya another glance, mulling over Sorayas lack of presence.

Strike me. Asami wipes her face with a napkin and throws it onto the table, finally making eye contact with Soraya. `Intimidation: 9`

I will not dodge, hit me as hard as you can.
||snombi||She didn't know either; to be honest, she didn't know how anyone could even *want* to have a genuine conversation with her, let alone have one. And perhaps she wasn't catching onto Asami's concern as she was mulling over all that she told her about. Although, Asami's next words were enough to somewhat take her out of the trance she was in. Soraya tilts her head a bit.

"I'm.. ah.. I.. I don't.. know.." She had no idea she may have come off like that.. In truth, she's done more than she thought she was capable of, especially during her "fun" adventure with Yuumi and Callista. She still thinks about it, how it was because of her that Yuumi was able to get out in mostly one piece. "..I.. I didn't.. eeeh.. even.. know.. I.. I was.. aa..ah.. acting.. like.. thh..that.. I.. I just.. am.. naturally.. like that.."

Naturally a pathetic wet cat at the bottom of the pecking order. That's how things were back at home, too, and at her job. She was used to being inferior, used to being the one who takes the fall for everything. Her natural temperament was being meek and small, as she'd overwhelm herself even trying to do more.

"..I just.. I.. I, umnh.." She can't really describe it well enough. "..I'm.. sorry..?" She was unsure if she even had to apologize for that, for once.
||yaoiprincess||Sorayas meekness should be appetizing to a snake like Asami but theres no joy to be had in this moment, this wasnt much of a victory. This was Goodness, is Asami feeling *guilty?* Why? Soraya needs to accept the truth of her situation if she wants to live, she doesnt want Soraya to die so shes trying to help. 

Perhaps she should say that as well Is her concern for Soraya and her disinterest in Akikos death not coming across properly? Seriously, Asami cant figure out how Mirai can have genuine conversations with Soraya because this was becoming a challenge.

I dont understand why you act weaker than you actually are, I feel as though youre a very capable individual but you hold yourself back by crying and hiding.
||snombi||What she wasn't expecting was Asami telling her these sorts of things, especially because she hardly knew the other woman. Of course, Soraya couldn't understand what any of this was like, although she doubted the point was to make her feel alienated. Although, what she couldn't help was an increasing inferiority, knowing fully well she couldn't accept death as well as Asami could. She didn't have a grandfather who forced her to pray for the deceased, she hurt just like anyone else did. 

She could only really stare, listening intently while she absently pulls on her hair. She pulls a little more the longer the story goes; it's not that she's bored, it's just something she does subconsciously. 

Soraya didn't want to apologize, for once in her life. Apologizing for something like this honestly felt disingenuous, and Asami's probably heard enough apologizing about it. She lowers her head a little bit, almost ashamed for even thinking about feeling upset for Akiko's death. 

"..I.. I un..understand.." She murmurs as her gaze goes to her lap. She was just risking herself for even *feeling* dread. Maybe she should stop feeling in general.. People would be happier..... And then maybe- She's inferior in every way, she thinks. She thinks so many horrible things about herself.
||yaoiprincess||Asami leans forward again to finish her meal. Im not purposely being heartless, Im just saving you time and energy by reminding you that Ms. Katsumis death was unavoidable and you did not know her well enough to allow it to affect you long term. If I allowed myself to continue crying over my brother, I wouldve gone mad. You cant afford such risks when the only thing stopping you from following in her footsteps are the points you earn. Be grateful youre alive and focus on surviving. Asami chews on her noodles while pulling out her comms device tapping.
||yaoiprincess||A neutral response is worse than no response, Asami desired some sort of substance but she wasnt satisfied until Soraya felt the same way she did. She was aware that the easiest way to get a point across is by spilling about ones experiences but the potential of personal details spreading around made her skin itch with disgust.

Though Soraya gave no impression that she was the type to gossip but in the event that this assessment is wrong, Asami could easily suffocate Soraya with a pillow while she sleeps.

Asami continues to eat in silence, allowing the unsettling tension to sink into the air before placing her chopsticks down neatly next to her bowl.

I had an older brother, Shigehiko. Already feeling annoyance fill up her chest, Asami deeply sighs and stares up at the ceiling.

Shigehiko died in the womb, I had the misfortune of being the child that was born *after* the miscarriage. My parents were happy to have a child regardless of circumstances but my grandparents werent particularly happy. They desired more time to mourn and I only served as a reminder of what was lost. I grew up. He didnt. My grandparents held a memorial every year at a local temple and whenever I visited their home I was met with a shrine of my unborn brother next to a picture of me and my grandfather would force me to kneel down and pray to it with him. I figured always assumed my grandparents werent very fond of me and when youre three years old, thats like the end of the world. *I wanted their approval.* So, I started to mourn the brother I never met. Id sit down and have dinner with my grandfather, just going on and on about how sad it was that the family lost the chance at having a male heir- *oh it mustve been awful news to tell the village- the loss of potential. He was so selfless that he died so I could live and now I have to make sure his soul can be comforted by praying to him every chance I get.* 

Asami closes her eyes.

I never brought it up to my dad since I figured he felt the same as my grandparents. He had a daughter instead of a son, he must be disappointed. But one day, I just felt so bad that I apologized to him for taking Shigehikos place and you know what he did? Asami didnt wait for Soraya to answer at all.

He kneeled down in front of me and laughed. *Mimi, you should be grateful that it was him instead of you. Theres no way anyone could prevent his death and crying over fate is such a bore, if you cry over every dead thing youll never stop, just appreciate that it wasnt your time.
||snombi||She sighs; she didn't want to remember Akiko as a statistic or something less than human. She wasn't a number to be recorded, because numbers didn't have flesh and bone, didn't put up a fight. They didn't bleed. 

It didn't change much. Soraya couldn't make peace with that, as much as she needed a reality check. She couldn't be realistic though, as she was often overwhelmed by everything and anything. She wanted to say something more, but she was too scared and couldn't reasonably stand up for herself. 

"..I see." Just a neutral response will be fine, right?
||yaoiprincess||Death was indeed inescapable and Asami has long made peace with the possibility of randomly dying. 40,000 people die every day, Akiko was part of the statistic and when another day comes, tomorrow or fifty years from now, Asami will also be part of that statistic. Soraya too.

There was nothing you couldve done to prevent her death, youve done nothing to earn the title as an awful friend. Asami leans over the table to slurp her ramen, how she eats without making a sound is a true mystery.

You shouldnt mourn over someone you barely know, itll hold you back from moving forward.
||snombi||Death was upsetting to her, no matter who it was. Death was inescapable, but she felt that Akiko could stand to run a little more before reaching death's door. 

"..She.. called.. me.. before.. I.. I heard.. her voice.. for.. for the last time.. She.. She promised she.. she would.. help me.." She stammers, but she continues to get her point across. Soraya looks down at her lap again.

"She.. confided.. in.. in.. m..mmm.. me.. I.. I feel like.. an awful.. fff.. friend.."
||yaoiprincess||Asami snaps apart her chopsticks and dips them into the hot broth. While her gaze wasnt fixed on Soraya, her thoughts certainly were. Yet, youre bothered by the death of Ms. Katsumi. Why is that?
||snombi||She looks a bit more put together than she did a bit ago, at least physically anyway. She just needed time to herself, really. She closes her eyes briefly at Asami's question and she takes a deep breath.

"I.. have.. yes." She murmurs. "..Knew someone that died, th..that is.."
||yaoiprincess||Its hard to imagine Soraya without Mirai supporting her and yet, here she is by herself for the first time and in relatively good condition. Asami was impressed. 

Have you ever been around a dead body or perhaps knew someone that died? Obviously the *too much* referred to the dead body preserved in rubble not too far away, she might as well cut to the chase.
||snombi||Of all people to sit next to her, she's surprised that Asami would want to be near her. Not that there was anything wrong with Asami, Soraya just thought she shouldn't occupy the same space as someone so much more.. elegant and refined. She blinks quickly and stares at the other woman as she tries to find what words to say.

"..Ms. Koyama." She dips her head in greeting. "And.. too.. much, truthfully.." She answers as she absently curls her hair around her fingers.
||yaoiprincess||Asami walks in carefully balancing her ramen and drink in her hands. Noticing Soraya sitting by herself, Asami walks over and places her food on the table.

A lot on your mind, Ms. Hasegawa? Asami slowly sits down next to Soraya and reaches for her chopsticks.
||snombi||The room where it happened, as it were. Still, she's.. curious about there being more in there, curious if there was a way to go down and get Akiko back. Her eyes fixate on where the hole in the wall as she sits down on a couch, hands folded in her lap.
||yaoiprincess||I Asami thinks about dissecting this but theres another assembly she just quietly pulls Theri to her feet and gets to walking.
||frooztiez||"....uhuhh.... i dont.... get hurt?" As smartassy of a statement this is, it's entirely genuine. ".ii have... pillows.... uhmmm... pillows everywhere.... and i- I don't owm.... knives....."
||yaoiprincess||Asami nods then turns to Theri with worry in her expression. Yes, your doctor writes you a prescription and faxes it over to your pharmacy to pick up. Though, if you havent been to a doctor before how do you recover your health?
||frooztiez||Following along with her hands, Theri tries her hardest to map this explanation out in her brain. ``[IQ: 5]`` ...she doesn't really get it, but at least she knows its painless now. "...oohh..." It's impossible to relate to Fortnite, so it just doesn't click in her brain fully. "..aand then... uum.... so.. do they do that... when you have the- the appointment?    i've..,,.. uumm.,.,. i've never been.. to the doctors.."
||yaoiprincess||Asami seems to be very excited by that, she starts making mental notes about all sorts of exercises, poses, and moves she could teach Theri whenever the opportunity arises.

Well, to explain it simply, the capsule is separated into two and one side is filled with pellets or a powder then the other side is pressed on top. A pharmacist usually performs that task by hand or with machinery. Asami wishes she could use the complicated words and math in her explanation. Making medicine is very painless.
||frooztiez||Even though her body language screams "I want to die/leave this hypothetical scenario", her eyes have the pure intention of *want* for ballet.
||yaoiprincess||11..
||frooztiez||"...iim...." *Social Check?* Theri just kind of trails off.

"...........................whhhaghtg???" No social check needed, Theri fully believes this. "..uumm...,, i ii guess thats'g.. better..... but... so they... do they... how do they... put the things in.,,. the capsules/..???"
||yaoiprincess||Its interesting, ballet can be very rewarding when youre dancing for fun rather than competitively. I can teach you basic moves if it interests you. 

Asami shakes her head and laughs a little. Luckily, nurses arent sacrificed for medicine. Only rats, mice, and donated corpses.
||frooztiez||"oo-oooh..hhh.. umm.. iis.., is ballet.. ccooll??     ii thought it.., i always thought..,. it would- would be cool to... to do." It's something she can do inside, and that's enough for her. She's really broadening her horizons from just fortnite (and swordplay but that's like a 1% thing). 

"..........uum.... do..... do thye... do they have to,,, to sacrifice the.... nurses for the.. medicines..?" What.
||yaoiprincess||Do I do anything? Asami repeats the question and tries to really think on it. Well, she doesnt do much either but at least she goes outside. Ballet. She hesitates then adds on. I started studying medicine with my father as well.
||frooztiez||Her smiling scares Theri. She begins to tremble a bit. "oohg... uuuhm. my apartment is... too small to..... shoot arrows in.. do.. do you do anyhtihng??        llike as as job i        . think you do,, things."
||yaoiprincess||Asami is so normal, shes even smiling a little. Ill keep your words in mind, thank you. May I ask what made you stop practicing archery?
||frooztiez||there is NO LORE in the rowdy room
||frooztiez||8....
||yaoiprincess||Roll advantage I cant believe this is happening
||frooztiez||``[SOCIAL: 1]`` Theri is vibrating too hard to process that she might have to be social right now. "oogh....  uum... iit... i think,.. its ,., you can.. learrn how.. if you put.. put your mind to- too it.."
||yaoiprincess||Thats amazing, I attempted to learn archery a few times when I was younger but I didnt have the eyes for it. My younger brother was quite talented though, he won a few awards. Roll social
||frooztiez||".uumm..,. ii.,.. my mom.. thought i was,,,, good....." She fidgets with her thumbs now, twisting an invisible ring as she vibrates.
||yaoiprincess||Asami lights up. Youve done archery? Were you any good?
||frooztiez||".......................nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooo................................ uumm....,,..,..., ii  ddid..... archery... uuum.. aand.d,." she warbles a little. ".......unnoo............    i didn't.. know about..... ffortnite then..."
||yaoiprincess||.Did you play Fortnite at school?
||pulsatilla||HELP
||yaoiprincess||
||frooztiez||IDK THERES LIKE 4 ANTS ON THE GROUND DOING FLIPS OR SOME SHIT
||frooztiez||DOG
||yaoiprincess||
||frooztiez||Theri sure is taking a while to respond!!! ROLL HIGHER THAN A ONE ROLL AGAIN
||yaoiprincess||1.
||frooztiez||"...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................." *Perception Check?*
||yaoiprincess||Really? Asami seems very amazed by that confession, like theres no way this girl stays at home playing Fortnite all day. Im sure you have some sort of skill you can pick back up. Didnt partake in any clubs or sports after school? Please Theri, shes trying to save your image you kicked a ball before right?????
||frooztiez||"......................................................................................................................................................nnnoo....................   uuumm.,.." She starts to pick at her sweatshirt, unsure if Asami will like her answer. "iiiuuh... i     play fortnite......,,,,,,,.,..,............................................................"  theri looks so normal to asami

"oohh..." She pauses for just a brief second. More free time? What's she gonna do with all of that? ...play more fortnite, she only needs her 1 hobby.
||yaoiprincess||That sounds entertaining, what else do you do outside of fortnite? Im assuming other technological hobbies. Theri did say she makes her own games and stays inside perhaps she codes? Asamis autism is winning thanks to her `-1!`

Were too young to retire but its a fairly easy process, I can teach you in the future. Then youll obtain more free time.
||frooztiez||"yyyeeah...hgh.........    ummm.,..,   aand. theres, ththeres the racing mode.,.     i like that one..... aandd,,........,! !  youg can make your.,, own oworld,,,,,,,. game.,..., oon.,,. ,.the unreal..... engine..... game,,,,,,,        thingf...,,.,," At least talking about Fortnite comes naturally to her. Trying to subvert Fortnite into Family Guy did NOT help when she was trying to talk to dante earlier... shes gotta stick to her guns.

"ooh..,h,    ii,,, don't know how to......... retire,,, uuh- ummm,...       ii...  have lots of.,, free....... ttimme...." *Perception Check?*
||yaoiprincess||Oh shes taking about video games still, Asami wouldve changed her answer to a *Yes, if theyre undead like in Silent Hill (PS2).* Fortnite lego and rythm game mode, Ill keep that in mind. Perhaps playing a video game for an hour or two will ease my mind in the future.

Theris actually very pleasant to talk to when she isnt melting from anxiety or hiding behind small plants, shes also incredibly funny! 

20 years, Ill be 43 and retired. Plenty of time to immerse myself into Fortnite. On that note, how did you end up playing it so often?
||frooztiez||"........yyeahhhhh....." Theri had no idea she has over 4 *years* of Fortnite time. ...maybe she needs to go outside... "uuuh......     iiiii...... uuuumh... i doo....................."

".....tthtten... you prob ably...      could............. could playh... the fortnite...  lego mode..... uum.... aasnd there's a..... rythm... gggame mode.....  uuh... they were gonna.,,.., aadd bears... but uuh... now its..... uum..... 1969....,. so you have too.... wait a bit...." She also begins counting on her fingers, trying to figure out just how long until FORTNITE is back and real. "uuum... it's... at least....... 20 years..."
||yaoiprincess||About 4.56 years worth of playtime, thats impressive. I guess you could count it as a career at this point. Asamis joking oblivious to the truth that fortnite is indeed a job for people.

Do I like- Asami turns her gaze back to Theri and smiles at the blunt question she doesnt know that Theri is still talking about video games. No, I could never but I have shot animals before. Bears Wolves Birds she counts each type on her fingers.
||frooztiez||"uuumm......     yyeeaah,,, i  hhave        um.....     iii think... llllllike.......         40,000    hours on..... it?    ii,.ts... not a lo.t...     ii couldf.... havemo re......" She probably has the record for the most hours in fortnite tbh whatever the record is she has like +4k hours on it. "...uummm... dooooo you like... shhhotting peeople??"
||yaoiprincess||Is this a video game? It cant be real life because theres no way Theri would drop herself in an island full of people.

Damn Asami is far from her expertise here but it does sort of interesting?

Oh that sounds entertaining, are you good at fortnite? I dont really play video games but Im interested in learning from someone experienced. Asami thinks this shit is like animal crossing, she wants to build a house.
||frooztiez||".......yyy.....eah..........." For heaven's sake, why can she only default to talking about people's hands?? Why can't it just be like... their favorite food or something? Why *hands*, who talks about *hands*????

Akin to telling a dog they're about to get a treat, Theri begins to vibrate with some unknown energy when the word 'fortnite' is said. "....uumhm. soo its lkiek  whenf you       umm so  oo theres 100 people and.. adnd they have to dorp onto this silsand and they fidght  tos see who is the  fi the last one anddd you can *build* there is *building* aand  its a battleroyale andf yyou can  c rank   90s.. haandd      i         likeee                         ittttttt.............................." She sure likes her fortnite!!! the entire crux of her character is the 90s....
||yaoiprincess||Theri seemed overly enthusiastic about hands and Asami had no clue what to make of it. Perhaps Theri has found a new interest in anatomy? Im sure hes happy to have them.

Pink suits you, its a nice color. Asami pauses for a moment before she still doesnt know what fortnite is and has to brace herself for looking stupid by asking what it is. Blue is also a good color but I unfortunately know nothing about fortnite. Can you explain what it is?
||frooztiez||"uuh... yy-yeah.... hee was... uum.........." She kind of just trails off, unsure of what to exactly say about her father. "hhe was...... uuuuuuuuuum......         he had...............       hands....."

no she is laughing because it is a STUPID question and she HATES THERI and wants her DEAD IN A DITCH.... Theri shrinks a little. ".......ii...like. pink..... uumh.h.. bbut the.... the fortnite.... the fortbite blue is........                  cooll.............................             ddddddo toyu dknow...... about.           fortnite...???????"
||yaoiprincess||Asami nods. Reminds me of my own parents, though my dad didnt give us anything if we broke rules. I dont remember what he did when that occurred. Asami squints as if itll squeeze the memories out of her brain.

When the topic changed to colors, a small laugh bubbled out of Asami. Shes not laughing at Theri, she seems more entertained! Nobody asked her that before. My favorite color is black but red is a close competitor. How about you?
||frooztiez||"....uooh... umm.....        oonly..... uum............... only my mom....... really did.... uuh.... my da.d.... didn't... like    giving people things..... uum.... easy...." Theri's obviously midly (quite) uncomfortable with this whole conversation, alas the *conversing* part 'forces' her to continue. "...uumm...  dddoo you have...... a favorte. color?"
||yaoiprincess||Is that so? Asami sits near Theri and throws her head back to stare at the ceiling. I never heard of getting gifts for doing something bad, did your parents do that often?
||frooztiez||"....oooh... uum.... i usually... only get gifts if..... ii .... yym..um... do something........ bbaad..." She starts to pick at her sweatshirt, mumbling about something as she does so.
||yaoiprincess||No. Asamis face goes blank WHAT is going on for her to say that? The cafeteria was only serving mysterious substances.
||frooztiez||She holds the candy bar as if it was a bomb. "......dddi.d...... ii do something....       uum... bbbad???"
||yaoiprincess||Asami is back with no food! She politely holds out a candy bar for Theri.
||frooztiez||She's gonna FINALLY move to the couch.
||yaoiprincess||Alright, Ill return with food. Asami walks right out she probably misinterpreted!
||frooztiez||She catches a "*......pplease...*" and that's it!
||yaoiprincess||`10..` Asami zoned out <:buh:1218752782375583754>
||frooztiez||"hhhhhhhh.gg................oo.oky............" She can't say it... at least she can't say it very loud. So, she whispers, mostly to herself, but Asami is still in the same room! 

*Perception Check? They're quite close to each other, so the DC'll be 14.*
||yaoiprincess||Asami knows its wrong to push a ladys buttons and she doesnt want to put herself into a position where she has to explain to Theri that she was gripping a knife.

They do not allow us to make our own food but I can retrieve food for you from the cafeteria? Asami worries that she accidentally broke Theri.
||frooztiez||Theri *really* doesn't want to talk about it, and she tried to say the word 'no' 2 times but was completely unable to, resorting to her pathetic little .

".........................ffood...................fg...ood.........fo.d............." and now she's lost her conversation spark/..... what a mess of a woman...
||yaoiprincess||`Perception: 12` Asami is blinking like a frog trying to understand Theri rn
||frooztiez||"...............uuuumm......." Is... is she allowed to call out the lie? Theri starts to tremble a little- she's never caught someone actually *lying* before. What does she do? oogghh, she doesn't like this feeling!!!! uuuh, what about... "......uuum........ tttthey... they let... you ..... umm.. make your....... owwnd food???"

"............................................................................................." Her voice is barely above her own breathing. *Perception Check?*
||yaoiprincess||`Theri can tell that Asamis lying, shes practically sweating trying to avoid giving an actual answer.`

Asami clears her throat and points at Theris arm with her index finger. May I ask what happened to your arm?
||frooztiez||Theri has many... many secrets....

She's got a thick, *very* old bandage wrapped around her arms, just barely hidden by her large sweatshirt. While she's quick to adjust it so it can't be seen, it's still there.

"...ooohh...." ``[PERCEPTION: 17]`` But her eyes are as wide as dinner plates. She SEES.
||yaoiprincess||At least it wasnt anything serious. Why one would need anything made of glass in a pillow fort is beyond Asamis knowledge and shes a bit too scared to ask.

Asami does stare as Theris hands with intrigue `Sight: 13` then looks down at the cut on her palm. Cant really hand wave this one can she?

My hand slipped while cutting steak, it doesnt hurt and is already healing on its own. `Roll perception`
||frooztiez||"....................uuummm........ pppillow fort...... andd..." She starts modelling a big box with her hands, to signify the pillow fort *stuff*. "..aaand.... um... glass... on top...... annd i.. tttripped..." The top of her head has healed enough to not worry about (hopefully).

Theri *very* slowly does the same. Nothing on her hands, but if Asami's looking around the hand area... *Perception check??!?!?!?!?*

".....wooah...." hands... and Asami knew what theri wanted to say... so cool... "..yyeah........ uum...             " Is she allowed to ask about the cut? She points her pinky at Asami's cut hand. "..umm.. what.......... happened?       sssoryr..y.."
||yaoiprincess||How on Earth do you drop a glass on your head? Asami sounds more amused than anything but she does try checking the wound over one more time.

When Theri calls attention to her hands, Asami blinks and holds them up a bit confused. Theri can see a healing cut on one of Asamis palms. 

Yes, Ive been told I have very delicate ones. Might as well go along with this topic. You also have hands.
||frooztiez||It's probably not *fully* healed, but her scalp seems fine, save for a few little marks that will probably become scars. The slight vibrating of Theri definitely doesn't make it easy to make out, though.

"umm.h.... iii        dropped a.........      a...... glass............,.. on my. head... yyeeagg.h..." Theri pauses, unsure if she's now allowed to use one of her many great conversation starters. ".......uuum......  yoou... have... handds..???" What.
||yaoiprincess||Asami winces in disgust at the sight of the bandage, she slowly starts to unravel it in hopes that Theris injury has healed by now. She can keep Asami busy until they both finally fall asleep. May I ask why you have an old bandage around your head?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Bar isclosed
||frooztiez||"..uuumum......" She doesn't really remember, flinching slightly as the other grows closer. Theri's head, aside from the fucking massive like week old bandage, is mostly fine! 

ohohhg... more people.f..g.... she wants to go back to fainted mode...
||yaoiprincess||You fainted Did you receive any medical attention from Callista or Lynceus? Do you hurt anywhere? Asami checks her head for any signs of a concussion.
||frooztiez||The snapping scares her enough to jolt her brain back into normal Theri mode, and now she's just mildly terrified of laying outside for so long.

"......uuumm??..,  iimm ..                f..                    aint. ..,e.d...../?" She holds the napkin daintily, trying to both keep it dry and dap at her eyes.
||yaoiprincess||Asami snaps her fingers and grabs a napkin to hand to Theri. Get a grip girl!!!! You went to the hole I assume, were you knocked out or simply fell asleep?
||frooztiez||She's starting to vibrate in her confused stupor. "gg..g.>??H?? wwggatt???" Still trying to process the first sentence, she wipes at her eyes to stop any tears.

"..u.ummhmmmm... wee went in th///.e..  wwaslll/.//?" That's the last thing she really remembers fully *being there* for.
||yaoiprincess||Come on. Get up. Asami doesnt see anything wrong with her words, its only for a job after all. May I ask why youre on the ground anyways?
||frooztiez||".................uumm??./?" Theri doesn't quite process Asami's sentence correctly, pulling her hoodie up to shade her eyes. Being *horrified* of making eye contact, instead she stares at her own feet, every so often glancing to the side.

*It... didn't really have a nice vibe???* Uncertain tears prick at her eyelids. Theri thinks soft things are nice.......  ??? Something just doesn't *work* mentally for little Theri, something about being vaguely insulted *not* on the internet, churns in her head into just being entirely unable to act. she's been stunlocked

Now she barely reacts to Asami's hand! What does this mean.... secret giver....
||yaoiprincess||A lot to take in. The cat noises. The engine-like screech. The giant fucking sword being cradled. Does she want to ask? *Does she really?*

Asami rubs her eyes and bends down a bit to offer Theri a hand. Whenever I watch you from afar I cant help but genuinely admire how uncaring you are about doing activity alone and never surrounded by others. She points to the couch. But you have to rest someone soft. 

Task done!
||frooztiez||Surprisingly enough, Theri isn't actually asleep, laying on the ground completely sprawled out. She'd found some kind of peace, most likely because she'd been alone with her thoughts.

ALONE NO LONGER! As soon as she's touched she *jolts* upright, letting out a confused *mmrrp* akin to a startled cat. With her sword clutched to her chest and in muddled shock, she attempts to respond. "eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeg..>>?????ahhelo......///?" shes very normal
||yaoiprincess||Asami is back but she looks absolutely terrible! Her wine has been cleaned up and locked away there goes her sleeping aid. 

She spots Theri on the floor like a welcome mat and simply nudges her with her foot. Sit up, the floor is dirty.
||frooztiez||she wakes up from her almost dying nap and is NOT happy she is NOT but she does nothing and lays there like a welcome mat
||bananices||NOOO
||bananices||Yeah:)
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus gives a little polite bow and watches them leave...no pingg
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Noo... I don't have it on me.." Lynceus is so close to just walking them outside...peepaw needs some sleep
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I can't...I appreciate you wanting to clean your own room though."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Understood," he nods and hands over some bandages and some lil alcholhol wipes. The med kit is slid away.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"...Uhm," Lynceus pauses again, "I can't give you the kit- I am sorry...and I'll clean your room, the uh, next time you're out then. I can give you bandages?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"...I can't give you the whole kit, but I can give you some treatment." He sets somethings down to give Adiel his full attention. "What do you need?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Iuhmare you injured?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||This isnt my barI just clean
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Bars closed,,,
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is busy cleaning up.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Cleaningcleaning
||sadpastry||SIIIIIIGH. She watches everyone leave and just. frowns really deeply. She goes to where Natsume is slumped and picks him up. Im gonna say thanks to adrenaline! Yuumi, come to *Yuumi* Yeah shes gonna follow and drag her buddy with her!
||bellboy||*Kali follows him*
||pulsatilla||Nope, he's still going after him- `Dex - 4` But of course... skull emoji. 

He doesn't care, he's obviously- going after Valmont, he's on a fucking mission right now... and on his way out he snatches a glass cup.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is picking up the medical stuff, cleaning up as much as possible in the meantime.
||yaoiprincess||Asami wordlessly gets up and starts leaving she is so out of it
||elainatime||Xavier will run up behind Valmont and walk away with him.
Dude, that was sick
||bellboy||" It's not your business everyone

# GO ! GET OUT OF MY BAR ! GO TO YOUR ROOMS GO FUCKING ANYWHERE BUT AROUND EACH OTHER ! GO TO YOUR ROOMS ! "
||starzono||Oh heck. He's been told to go to his room. But, he isn't done.
"It doesn't, Yuumi. Get *over* it."
He takes off his hat and one of his gloves, before *poof*. No glove. `Performance: 24`

He'd just turn and begin walking out unless stopped.
||pulsatilla||"IT HURTS *ME*--" ` Dex -3` Yeah, he's... just really pathetic looking. That's all he's getting in, he's not stopping his pursuing- but he does stop talking as he's tired of wasting his breath.
||sadpastry||*Oop.* Callista pales a little. She looks at Yuumi, almost as if she were asking a question.
||bellboy||*These people....they've gotten on his last nerve.....He inhales...and shouts.*

# "EVERYONE GO TO YOUR DAMN ROOMS RIGHT NOW ! "
||sadpastry||She shoots Xavier a grateful smile. Its obvious shes been crying. I am glad to hear that. Thank you, my friend.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks like a war veteran. She doesnt want to hear all this right now she sits down with tienne and stares at the ceiling speechless.
||elainatime||I think Adiel, like, fell But were all okay, I think.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is looking very relieved that an adult (everyone is a grown ass adult here) is here
||snombi||Considering this argument has gone on for way too long and she doesn't want to really BE here.. She's barely able to will herself to stand and she quickly shuffles out, or well, as quickly as she's able to.
||sadpastry||Is anyone injured? Asking the whole room. Forget about them.
||sadpastry||help.<:TATSU:1178265006350008391>
||starzono||`Dex: 21` Yuumi isn't getting any closer.

"OF COURSE I KNOW I AM BEING RUDE TO YOU!!!! And I am not going to apologize for it because you have been rude to me as well!!! I! Cannot! Stand you!!! You haven't even owned up to anything you did either?! Or given any sort of genuine apology?! I was doing my DAMN JOB!!! AND YOU CANNOT STOP ME FROM DOING IT!!!! I am good at ONE thing and I embrace it!!!! Do not blame me for doing something that doesn't hurt ANYONE!!!!"

Oh! Would you look at that! Everyone is back!!! :D
||bellboy||*Kali looks and...takes in what exactly is going on here. Will wait for Valmont to speak.*
||sadpastry||Callista turns to face. *the group.* with wide, irritated eyes. The blood takes more importance than their fight. Shes looking for anyone injured wordlessly!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is wincing, but hes standing talljust in case..damn this *is* his fault kind of moment
||pulsatilla||`Dex - 9` Damn you.... he'll get there one day.

"It shouldn't matter! If I am in the vicinity, would it kill *YOU *to not do it? Or is your proudness bigger than decent humanity?!? I don't forgive you, I will never forgive you. You don't even acknowledge how rude you have been to me, stop playing this off as a me thing- You have been nothing but a cruel person to me from the START. Stop trying to downplay this, stop trying to make me out to being crazy, just SHUT UP AND ADMIT YOU'RE WRONG."
||sadpastry||Callista is just waiting for the natural end of this argument. On standby still if necessary by the backrooms door!
||yaoiprincess||Asamis stress is off the charts, she moves away a bit and thinks of every therapy trick in the book before she has a breakdown.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theyre leaning unconsciously together
||starzono||`Dex: 13` Still hasn't gotten him. He's slippery.

"Yes, yes, apologies for the threat. That was out of line. I understand that much. I got upset and threatened you because of it. I will accept that I was in the wrong for that."
He can admit he was wrong there, he knows that it was very much a bad thing to do. Threatening people with burning them is not okay and Valmont recognizes that!

"How is doing magic for others tormenting you? I do it for *fun*, not for *you*. People ask, I deliver. It's what I am good at. And I do appreciate you paying off the debt. I do. Sincerely. But, good god, live a little?? Will it really kill you for me to make things disappear and re-appear?? Guess a person's card??"
||bananices||They :I  but are not going to press the matter.
||pulsatilla||`Dex- 11` He's still trying, struggling.

"Well it did offend me! I was in the room! I was there before you even went inside! I was talking to someone and you started doing that! I shouldn't have to inconvenience myself for sake of my boundaries! You should learn to stop when someone says stop! And regardless if it was an empty threat or not, *I* didn't know that- your intention was still the same to me! To make me fearful and to make me shut up- how DARE you try and twist this to seem like nothing at all!"

He squints his eyes, his teeth bearing. "I'm talking to you, and only you. But sure, while I ask the room- let's also see if anyone knew how you threatened to burn me with your lighter! How even at a party, where I was doing *nothing* but sitting and getting bullied by you and Xavier, you still did your magic in front of me- tormenting me? MOCKING ME? How even when I was upset with you I still paid your *pathetic* candle debt- yet you won't even respect a simple boundary of mine?"
||bananices||Etienne leaves distance between them, but does try to signal them, pointing a finger at them before bringing it back to gesture toward their own chest and holding up an ok sign. They tilt their head towards the exit, as if offering a reminder it exists.
||starzono||Hed turn to Asami for a moment, and like a flip of a switch he smiled to her and gave a small bow.
Apologies, mademoiselle Asami. I am quite upset. I am not going to do anything rash, I assure you!!

`Dex: 15`
Pivotting around Yuumi, he just tskd.
Well, pardon *me* for doing my *job*. It was nothing to offend you, I was not doing anything to anything you owned. You could have stepped away! Closed your eyes! Simple solutions?? And!!! I wasnt going to burn you!!!! Empty! Threat! But there is a difference between your task being to ruin a top and ruining all the other things I gave???? AND PUTTING ON EXTRA INK??? You were lucky monsieur Kali is good at cleaning. *Lucky*.

He rolled his eyes.
Me? Self centered? Ask anyone in this room if they think that! Anyone!!!
||yaoiprincess||Asami tries to move Valmont but `Nat 1` she ends up retracting her hand. This is not something you should be fighting about right now.
||bananices||Prompted to attention only when voices raise, he returns to his spot at the bar in the meantime. "I wonder if we're above ground," Etienne hums into his glass thoughtfully.
||sadpastry||SO L!!!!
||sadpastry||Callista typed something really fast. Then she looks at Asamis hand and sighs. Letting the boys duke it out bc.. no one is rolling well right now.
||pulsatilla||"I told you to stop doing that near me! And you ignored me! You ignored my boundaries and continued to do something I had asked you countless of times to stop doing! From the very start, you've never cared about anything I've said! I don't *like* your magic, yet you don't care! So why should I care about anything you do?!? The clothes were for a task- clothes you threatened to *burn* me over! I didn't even initiate violence on you, nor did I even threaten you- your first reaction was to try and scare and hurt me!" `DEX- 4` He's still walking up to him, hands reaching to grab, even if he's slow and shaky from all the adrenaline. 

"Well I'm going to tell you something you need to hear! You're the most self centered person here! You can't set aside your ego for sake of someone's boundaries! You don't even tell me anything, all you do is mock and imply things about me to other people!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Whisper back
||bananices||He is  alert..
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceuss hairs are standing
||yaoiprincess||Its like the most basic butter knife injury dw
||aias_||most serrated butter knife...
||yaoiprincess||Self-harm/hand injury ||Asami allows the dull blade to cut into her hand and takes a breath when blood spills from her palm. She lets go and grips onto a napkin instead. She is calm. In control.|| I have no clue but it stops today.

Asami stands up and quietly slips inbetween the two of them. Please cease your behavior for the time being.
||starzono||Another dodge out of the way, if not barely. `Dex: 6` He does not see Yuumi as a threat.
Disrespectful? Of *course* I do not respect you! You think I am a demon!! Because I do magic!! Of all things!! You squirted water on me and could have very well ruined my clothes that were made by my closest friends?! You couldnt answer a simple question when you did that, what makes you think I would EVER respect you? I would not say I *bully* you, I am simply telling you everything that you need to hear. And now, when everything was done and I was doing what I was requested to in giving drinks to everyone, you refuse and kick the glass! Wow! Incredible, really!!!
||bananices||Etienne has not met this punk, and leans over to Asami curiously. "Do they know each other or something?"
||pulsatilla||"I'm sick of you! All you ever do is be disrespectful- I paid your debt, the least you could do is leave me alone- and yet! You don't! Every chance you get, you ridicule me and *bully* me." `DEX- 5` He's not stopping, he's trying to grab him.

"You threaten to burn me, and you proceed to try and step down on me! Even at parties, you mock me, you have nothing but malice in everything you do to me!"
||sadpastry||Okay well. Great. Callista is going to walk infront of the backrooms hellhole door and body block it from these people while she watches the beef, done adjusting her gloves and now watching with a glare. This is *ridiculous.* Too tired for this! Shes in nurse mode again. Standing by.
||yaoiprincess||`Composure: 12` Asami tries to sit down in front of her dinner and ignore the scene around her but when her hand goes to cut the steak `Nat 1` She squeezes her hand around it instead.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Oh Mr. Vargas were really in it now
||starzono||`Dex: 18`

He raised a brow, moving out of the way.
And then he *laughed*.
What are you *doing*?
||yaoiprincess||Thats why we dont worry!
||sadpastry||Callista comes back inside, in the midst of pulling her gloves back on. She collected herself and is immediately STUNNED. I *WHAT?????*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||With a butter knife
||pulsatilla||`Dex- 14` Nah, he's done. Yuumi flings his hand out to smack Valmont right to his cheek.
||yaoiprincess||She was cutting steak dw
||aias_||is it a butter knife?
||bananices||Get his ass!!!!
||starzono||He turned to Lynceus. What? He isnt wrong!

He looked back to Yuumi, gesturing like hes just yapping. Mockingly. He does not Care!
||yaoiprincess||`???: 4%` Asami reaches for a knife.
||bananices||Etienne goes back for the glass he'd left behind here, taking his whiskey from his pocket and pouring himself a proper one.
||pulsatilla||"Then evidently, walkie-talkies aren't *working*." 

He takes a deep breath. "How am *I* being a hero? I'm not even the one trying to go in?????" He stares, like Valmont's crazy for that one.
||yaoiprincess||Asami
||bananices||He exhales in amusement.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Monsieur! French for THATS outta POCKET
||starzono||He saw the glass get kicked on to the floor. He is *fuming*. He offered it out of the generosity in his heart despite everything. And THAT happened?!
Stop trying to be a hero, Yuumi. You arent one.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is holding her head. I beg of you all, please cease this.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I- Ive been trying-
||bananices||"I could go back" he offers. Dude please do not you are not for this job.
||pulsatilla||"Radio Kali right now then, and ask if he needs help."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The- the walkie talkie??
||pulsatilla||"They aren't stuck. Me, Soraya, and Callista have navigated the majority of what's in there. The only *threat* was the room that collapsed, which we got out of with Kali's help. He told us to *leave*. And he will tell *all of you the same*." He stands up, knocking the glass of water.

"The rest of the rooms are clean and empty, they have *snacks* and *water* in there." He huffs, face turning a shade of red.

"The- THERE ISN'T EVEN CELL SERVICE IN THERE. LYNCEUS." HE'S REACHING A BREAKING POINT.
||yaoiprincess||Asami walks in and then immediately regrets it.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Id go myself Mr. Akiara, by my mothers life. I cant though, he rubs his head. Someone just needs to get in there to just radio and make sure theyre okay- I tried from here but its too far or soemthing- please.
||starzono||Werent you the one who said that we were to listen to monsieur Lynceus? Mirai is right. What if they *are* stuck?? Hypocrite, really.
||pulsatilla||"He lifted an entire metal cage, nearly by himself. He will be *fine*. No one knows where they are going, he made it *crystal-clear* to stay out of his way."
||snombi||<:wah1:784944789333213185> she
||pulsatilla||If Penelope weren't in his hair right now, he'd be swearing. He turns to look over at Lynceus. "Kali gave us instructions to not go back in, and to rest outside of here. He's going to drag them out- why on earth are you trying to send in more people who have no clue where they're going unlike Vargas? Are you trying to get people hurt?!?" Sorry, he's fuming.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Mr. Vargas is in there? His eyes get a lil watery I know hell be fine- I justoh, he pauses. Please dont fight. But- I. The number of people missing- I think it may be necessary. If Mr. Vargas sees you again, blame my anxiety. You all have the ability to radio me and each other I think, just in case paging doesnt work.  I know its more finicky. Just try to find them- thats what ImIm thinking is best.
||bananices||Get his ass...
||starzono||I said if it was *thought* to be necessary. I have plenty of faith in them but also no one knows where they are or if things happened.
He does not hesitate to be snarky to Yuumi.
||snombi||She lets this happen, as she does most of the time. She liked when Mirai played with her hair.. <:flomshed:1058576838986846312>
||pulsatilla||"It is *not* necessary. Kali and Natsume will drag the rest out, you all need to have more faith in them." He grunts, not looking up from his phone. 

"Listen to the bellhop, he will be the one to deem if it's necessary going back in."
||starzono||I also do not mind going back in with Mirai, if we think that is necessary!
||starzono||But how much longer should we wait before someone goes and sees if the others are, safe?
||starzono||Trapped? I mean. I do not *think* so. Unless you count glass in shoes and falling through floorboards.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I hope everyone gets out ok- no one got trapped, right?
||starzono||
He places the cups by Yuumis feet.
||snombi||She nods very slowly.. She's trying to keep herself together too and she had the urge to let the couch reclaim her. She slowly lowers onto her back again. <a:zsmatchasleep:765175364922114118>
||pulsatilla||He doesn't take it. (im sorry valmont ily)
||starzono||He is so helpful that hes even giving Yuumi juice and water. Take THAT, Yuumi. You get liquids in cups!!!!
||pulsatilla||Back inside, rubbing his forehead... headache. He takes a seat onto a couch, going back to poking his phone.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Of course, he nods taking a couple of breaths, trying to keep it together. Please rest now, as much as you can.
||snombi||She raises her arm and coughs into her elbow. "..I.. I.. ju..just.. fe..feel ba..bad th..they.. hhh.. haven't.. I.. I ju..just.. wa..wanted to.. he..help.. A..Aak.. Aki.. Akiara.." And she did just that, she hoped. She remembers her arms burning, her hands begging her to stop, but she wouldn't let go of him.

"..I.. th..thank you.. M..Mi..ster.. Le..Lebe..dev.."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||It- he sighs looking towards the hole. I am sure I cant say anything to make you change your mind from that, but know I dont agree andTheres still a lot of people that havent returnedyou cant be at fault of that.
||snombi||With a trembling hand, she takes it to wipe her tears away. She sniffles as she tilts her head up to face him. "..It's.. ook.. okay.. I.. It's.. mm..my.. f..fault.."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Hes just about done, and his face in his same mode of contemplation. Im sorry, once again he hands her a handkerchief.
||snombi||She winces and only cries more as he's working, but she's relieved that it's getting looked at.. She's unable to look away while Lynceus was working, staring down as her breathing quickens once again. "hhhhh.." 
||starzono||I can do that!!!
He gets juice for everyone here. And places it by them.
Same with water. Just. Placing cups next to everyone probably inconveniently but hes trying.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Im going to clean your cuts first, he explains, his voice softening, its going to sting, Deep breaths and.. 
#He (22) works carefully like a professional, cleaning, disposing and bandaging up, being sure to make sure she doesnt have any stray splinters or anything. Its going to take a second, but shes getting all patched up.
||starzono||He just. Well. So many people have left.
So is there anything I can do to help anyone here?
Hes just saying this to the room. To avoid going stir crazy. He cant do medical things but if theres *anything* he can do he is so willing to try.
||snombi||Her arms and legs are bruised heavily and her hands are also equally bruised, cut, and covered in dried blood. <:WAH:779053117663870987>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Whats clearly injured about her again..? Lynceus has just been prepping stuff for her.
||sadpastry||.Wait, I am NOT HAVING A BREAKDOWN She whisper shouts as she leaves!
||snombi||She is getting stressed by literally everything. She's going to wait until they're, uh. Done. With that.
||sadpastry||She feels so popular, all these hands being held..
||yaoiprincess||Asami glares back. No you do not. She follows.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi strikes a glare at Asami. "I've got it covered."

Nope. He's dragging her out.
||sadpastry||Callista grimaces when she does hold her hand. Yeouch! She looks at Yuumi though, trying to gauge the vibe. Yes or no?
||yaoiprincess||Asami reaches out and tries gently grabbing Callistas hand. Let me come with you then.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I- Im just sayingeveryone heard what noise was made. I dont think.. he shuts his mouth, nervous before stating, please be quickand quiet. Stay safe
||sadpastry||I am not. Callista holds her hand out to Yuumi with a wince.

..It is nothing I can not fix alone. It is under my gloves, I am fine.
||pulsatilla||"Would you rather she have a breakdown here, or in private?" He snaps his gaze over at him.

"We will return, as I am waiting on people to come out of there."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Please dont leave this room yet. <:TATSU:1178265006350008391> <:TATSU:1178265006350008391>
||yaoiprincess||She is ignoring Yuumi sorry king
||yaoiprincess||Asami will kneel in front of Callista in the meantime. Callista, are you sure youre not injured?
||pulsatilla||Yuumi takes a stand, shuffling over to Callista. "Bathroom break." He's holding his hand out to her. You know the drill.
||sadpastry||She sinks back into her couch with a teary eyed scowl.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Everyone please, he looks back and forth between women. I can take care of itand if anyone else, has anything else. Ill do it, he looks towards Soraya. Which one do you want me to look at first? <@272831332059447297>
||sadpastry||Let me do it.
||snombi||
||yaoiprincess||`6` Asami nudges Lynceus and whispers. Tend to the girl please, Im still slightly tipsy.
||sadpastry||Callista looks so the both of them, looking down at her hands holding the supplies before glancing back up, especially giving Lynceus a look. She wipes some soot from her face, inhaling sharply before just accepting her fate and the water from Asami, slowly sinking into the couch behind her. Trading the drink for some medical supplies.

*Fine.* If someone comes back though, and they are injured, I will see to them myself. I am.. I am *fine.* I do not need this break. Even then, her head lowers and her hands painfully grip her thighs and cup. Wincing with the thought of her splinters digging into her skin more. She mumbles something as she avoids eyecontact.
||yaoiprincess||Asami keeps awkwardly glancing over at Soraya, girl is fucked up so bad.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi lowers the maid dress, glancing over to the crowd nearby Soraya.
||starzono||Since no ones telling him how he can help, hes tapping on the wall because man is trying so hard not go crazy. He literally cannot stand not helping and hes struggling to stand still. Not a great time.
||snombi||She looks awful, but y'know.
||yaoiprincess||Asami corrects herself. I will tend to her.
||sadpastry||HELP
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He takes a deep breath to state as stern as possible: Your heart rateand youre shaking like a leaf, he lifts her arm up, gently, pointing with his eyes to her hands. Drink water, and sit, he releases her.
||yaoiprincess||Asami stands up and grabs a cup of water, she walks over to where Lynceus and Callista are and calmly speaks. Im sure Mirai has that handled already.
||sadpastry||Callistas hand whips towards Lynceus, eyes wide. She glances at him and Asami, and you may notice she hasnt blinked in several minutes. May I please treat Soraya first? I am fine. She She is not. *Please.* Then Then I shall rest.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus stands up, putting Callistas hands down by grabbing at her wrist. I- I understand that not all of you you are injured but- please. Please sit down and rest. II beg you. That means you Miss Callista, and- everyone else. He takes a deep breath, You all need it- he mutters towards the end.
||pulsatilla||YuuMI COUGHS at what Callista just whispered to him, leaning forward and slamming the maid dress over his face.
||starzono||Since everyones doing things, and he isnt doing things, hes *really* not jiving. He doesnt know medical things either.
So, what are we supposed to do anyways? Anything that I can do? To help? In any way?
Hes trying to pitch in at least :)
||yaoiprincess||Asami stops mumbling for a second. Do you need any medical assistance, Callista? Im able to provide the best I can.
||snombi||Soraya, on the other hand, looks like she's a step away from breaking down entirely. Her breathing quickens and she feels dizzy.
||sadpastry||Okay, is that because of scrapes or bruises? I will make it better. Just sit tight, I have you covered. You are doing well, Soraya. Mirais free to pop off tho. Slay king.

Oh, Yuumi.. Callista wraps up what shes doing for her buddy, gently patting his head before whispering and pulling back. Ready for the next one!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Go ahead,,,
||yaoiprincess||Asami sits down and rubs her head, shes mumbling something in Mandarin.
||snombi||Hi, Mirai.. <:melting:771845244198322256>
||snombi||She lifts her face up from the couch, looking like an absolute mess. She's trembling again and she barely wills herself to speak. ".. ....... .. ......."
||pulsatilla||Yuumi's clutching his phone, staring at something. Callista roll perception. He's very tame and letting miss girl fix him up.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is setting glasses of juice and water out like people are catering
||sadpastry||Soraya, honey, when Im finished with Yuumi, can you tell me where you are hurt? Hands, right?
||yaoiprincess||Charm school you got this Mirai
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Rizz them back
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Or composure
||yaoiprincess||Charisma
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Charisma
||yaoiprincess||Perception maybe
||yaoiprincess||UH IDK
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Because Callista got it Lynceus gets up and just prepares drinks, something to keep himself busy and make his pacing look normal.
||snombi||Soraya is crying on the couch.
||sadpastry||``

*Minor abrasions and bruising, head wound is minimal..* She mumbles to herself. She uses her new materials to treat Yuumi with a `18`. He feels better already and looks a lot less dirty too!

She looks at Mirai and Asamk while she works, glassy eyes wide with worry.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is going to stare at Mirai. Mirai, please do not cause any more stress than need be. `Intimidation: 13`
||maamthatsafederaloffense||HE- Ah! Dont go back in!
||starzono||He would just shake his head a bit, but he aint going back in. Hes antsy, though. Cant stand being able to do nothing to help.
||pulsatilla||Ask bonathon, but as far as I know it's just a simple flesh wound. 

Yuumi's kind of chilling, just letting Callista do as she pleases. Still pouting, of course.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He is shaking his head. DONT DO IT.
||sadpastry||Okay. Callista is immediately hanging over him, while she replies to Valmont, I understand as well But for the amount of work I may have to do, *please* just remain on standby. Valmont, my friend. *Please.* 

How bads his head wound? Any other cuts and scrapes?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(17) eyes wide opoen...
||yaoiprincess||I ensure you, theyll be fine with Kali and the worm to guide them. We need to regroup in the meantime.
||starzono||Look, I understand! I do! But also it does get a bit alarming the longer we know they are not here.
He does not want to sit. He is fine where he is :)
||pulsatilla||"I am fine." He groans, but finally sits down, slumping deep into the couch cushions.
||yaoiprincess||Can we all *please* sit down.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ac-" Lynceus is SNITCHING, hes pointing.
||sadpastry||I did not say that. She frowns. I need people to just stay here though. Please. You were unscathed once, you may not be so lucky a second time.
||yaoiprincess||9..
||starzono||It doesnt hurt to be concerned, mademoiselle.
He sighed. It is troubling!
||sadpastry||You did good, Lynceus. Thank you very much for your aid. She takes ALLLL of it before marching over to Yuumi. 

Sit *down.* An usual venom settles on her tongue. Roll percep whoever wants!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus is just handing Callista what she needs and listening to everyone else. 

Im waiting on a few more people he whispers a little, not knowing how to put his voice in their convo.
||yaoiprincess||I trust Kali and the annoying one to help them.
||sadpastry||Do *not.* We have people on the case, do *not* go back inside.
||starzono||So, how long until we try finding everyone else?
||pulsatilla||thats the reply
||pulsatilla||
||sadpastry||It is about time I check your head.
||sadpastry||She nods to the everyone, wearing a button up shirt and shorts with her hair down, still with her long gloves and socks. Its weird. Thank you for verifying your state. Adrenalines BUMPING.

HEADWHIP TO YUUMI. Sit down.
||yaoiprincess||We all made it out okay. Asami assured.
||pulsatilla||"I'm fine." He's about to sleep standing up.
||starzono||Im not hurt!!
Thumbs up!!
||sadpastry||Speaking of, she looks around the room, dust and grime along her face and clothes. Is anyone else injured so far?
||sadpastry||Callista nods and smiles, I understand. My main focus is Yuumis head and anyone else with flesh woulds as such. Anyone else who is injured can.. be inspected by me with my own items momentarily. Her hands are totally fine anyways..
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus halfway wadding up some cotton balls, pauses, thinking in it, I know it sounds cruel- but, please use it sparinglythere isnt that many.
||bananices||He laughs. How off-course weve gotten before dessert too..
||yaoiprincess||Thank you, Lynceus. Asami isnt injured she just feels bad for him.
||sadpastry||gm guys
||sadpastry||Callista marches over to Lynceus. She was going to go to him anyway! In her sorry clothed state, she makes soft little grabby hands for the medical supplies. May I see them to treat my friends? <:smilesmile:1216153881457983700>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just stares at him. "Okay."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He winces a little, So I came over with some suppliesI figured some people might be hurt.
||starzono||Oh goodness. Well. Hes still going to stand by the wall. Listening to everything because this seems BEYOND him.
||snombi||She soon ends up laying down instead, laying on her side and face buried into the back of the couch. She was pathetic wet cat right now.
||pulsatilla||He forces himself up, and hobbles over. "What."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I need to air fry wonton
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He looks so worried, and starts opening up the kit making vague noises. Mirai gets at most some nods of acknowledgment 

Hes setting them out as he puts out things. W-When I heard the noise he begins, his voice breaking slightly, trying not to cry. He motions Yuumi to come closer.
||snombi||Guh, she needs a seat too. She sits before Lynceus has a word.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi takes the water and drinks some of it, before slowly glancing over to Lynceus. Staring.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Lynceus has been sitting here anxiously sitting at the hole. He stands, perplexed as he counts the heads and the state of the people there, hes just been waiting anxiously.
||yaoiprincess||Asami chomps on her lollipop and smiles at tienne. That was a fun date yes?
||starzono||Here we are!
So! Those were the walls, huh?
||bananices||wheeee
||pulsatilla||Yuumi's gonna just. Go take a seat to the nearest couch or bar stool.
||pulsatilla||Back to here...

Taking it on the nose hes gonna join this merry band of hole explorers
||starzono||Well. In that case. Guess they gotta head on in. If it's what's the cause of the noise, after all!
||bellboy||*Kali here....he stares at the hole before hanging his head....groan.....he walks into the hole, ignoring any greetings.*
||starzono||"Haha, definitely! What a relief! In some cases."
||.wozwald.||Popping in.

Already a mass gathering well now you know you arent going mad, Mister. Valmont.
||bananices||"Hello everyone," they bow toward the entrants. "I'm going to enter that opening now. Feel free to join us."
||yaoiprincess||Asami walks over to the wall and presses against it
||starzono||There's a HOLE?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||the wall beckons asami..
||yaoiprincess||Asami turns to tienne and then looks around is it coming from the hole ?
||bananices||"If you get too sober, I'll keep a first aid kit." He raises the bottle of whiskey towards her before stuffing it into his huge inner jacket pocket.
||starzono||Here he is now! Following Mirai!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||really near...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||when that noise happened... it seemed...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||hey you two...
||yaoiprincess||Asami clears her throat and fixes her posture. I am sober. Completely sober. My blood alcohol level would make a breathalyzer jealous. She lightly pats her face. I do not cuss, I do not stumble, I am a perfect lady. 

She stands up (slowly) and takes a deep breath.

I am ready.
||bananices||...They pour & help themself to that glass of whiskey first.
||bananices||"Oh my. I suppose so."
||yaoiprincess||<@357641088208732181> Asami is gesturing towards the giant hole in the wall. Dude my companion. Partner. We should go inside that.
||yaoiprincess||No he has the whiskey.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I mean,,, are u gonna leave etienne behind?
||yaoiprincess||Is it still open
||maamthatsafederaloffense||To Etinenne and Asami, the three just seemingly picked a random ass wall, and let themselves into the unknown, dim dark area.
||yaoiprincess||Your words are very beautif- WHAT THE FUCK?
||sadpastry||Callista just smiles to Asami. I am protected with love and support, from you and others around me. I shall be okay.

.Um.. Okay, farewell. POOF VANISHED!!!!
||yaoiprincess||Asami is staring she turns to tienne and mouths *what the fuck?* at some point.
||sadpastry||callie yuumi soraya
||snombi||She is basically a little chihuahua. She shuffles over, still not saying anything because she's in the "speak unless spoken to" mode.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||who's coming in?
||yaoiprincess||I shall not interrupt Asami inhales her mashed potatoes and hiccups. I do worry for you, extremely. A large amount of worry and anxiety.
||pulsatilla||He pats Callista's back, gently. "If you ever need to tap out, we can." He also beconks Soraya over, come little purse dog.
||sadpastry||Callista turns around and just.. grimaces. .That had a rude tone. I am sorry, Yuumi, but it is fine. I will be fine. Will she though?

And sweet Asami too. Angel. And I am okay, thank you for the offer. I have something to attend to though. AKA. She is doing something to the wall. She turns around to focus on what shes doing, red pen in hand.
||pulsatilla||"Well for you I wouldn't mind." He scrunches up his face.
||yaoiprincess||Asami puts down her glass and utensils. Callista, you look very exhausted. Do you wish to eat and drink with tienne and I?
||snombi||She raises a hand to wave at her, although there's a concerned look in her eyes and overall expression when she looks Callista's way. <:awwww:1158234237296709684>
||sadpastry||You do not wish to wait. Too idle, yes? She goes to a familiar part of the wall. 

I am *fine.*
||pulsatilla||"Do... you want to wait a bit before...?" He gestures her over to where he and Soraya are standing.

||yaoiprincess||Nat 20
||sadpastry||Callista walks in. Instead of her usual sunny demeanor and full dress though, shes wearing shorts, thigh high socks, slippers, and then a button up shirt under one of Yuumis sweaters. In her gloved hands, she has two pens, and her hair is down, wet from a recent shower.

..*Hello.* A weak smile plasters on her features for Soraya and Asamis sake. She sees them. Roll percep if you guys want!
||pulsatilla||Yuumi winces when looking at his phone, erm...
||yaoiprincess||`Tolerance: 5` She looks at it again and does this
||maamthatsafederaloffense||https://tenor.com/view/spongebob-maid-spongebob-maid-cartoon-mad-gif-24010454
||yaoiprincess||You can tell she jealous because she poured another glass and chugged it
||pulsatilla||He got that shit on..fr....
||yaoiprincess||Asami is staring at it
||pulsatilla||Yeah...
||yaoiprincess||Wait is Yuumi in his dress
||maamthatsafederaloffense||omg... whos is they
||snombi||She nods and she's going to wait.. Oh boy!
||pulsatilla||"And now we wait." For our special guest. . .
||snombi||Stepping in. Wowie.
||pulsatilla||Into here.... nearby the exit.
||yaoiprincess||`Asami takes forever to reply so you can tell shes a little tipsy (understatement) but shes so normal!`

Asami stares at tiennes expression in awe for a moment before slowly glancing down at her utensils. She picks them back up and tries cutting off another piece of her steak. As long as you continue to pursue justice and feel the way you do know, Im positive that youll reach far in your career.

Asami perks up at the mention of a toast, she pulls the fork out of her mouth and bitterly smiles at the mention of rigorous training. Practice is quite the horror story but I must admit that I have it easier than others, training is only one part of the journey. Lots of promising dancers have to concern themselves with entertaining and obtaining sponsors to fund their career. I could tell so many tales about injuries, improper instruction, anxiety, lack of income, breakdowns, its deeply saddening. I feel sorry for them.
||bananices||He shifts in his position, unused to taking that sort of... compliment? Praise? That's how they see it at least, and it surely doesn't feel deserved. "I hope to be that kind of person...  I can't say too much regarding that, and at the end of the day I'm still a piece in a broken system, but I will always do what I can." Something about their expression has hardened. They take the matter very seriously.

But it's time for drinks! :D "Wonderful. We could toast to new things. I don't know too much about the world of ballet... but from my perception it seems able to be... quite rigorous."

[Perception: 12]
||yaoiprincess||Asami sympathetically gazes at tienne and drags her nail around the rim of her glass. I appreciate anyone willing to go against the status quo for real justice. Theres so many victims out there, people hiding in their houses instead of peacefully exploring their neighborhood, they need some sort of hope to cling to.

She sighs and grasps her drink to finish it in one swallow. I never had whiskey, Ill have what youre having. `Tolerance: 4`

At the mention of her career, Asami chuckles and stares down at her shoes. Ive been dancing since I was a little girl, I always wanted to be a ballerina and worked hard every day until I started landing bigger and bigger roles. Nothing exciting. `Roll perception`
||bananices||They nod in contemplative understanding. "It's tough. The idea of retribution is real easy to get attached to when one personally feels it is due... but most countries' laws as they stand are full of moral and ethical contradictions. It all makes me very queasy, and it's why I drink in the first place," he exhales in guilty cynicism.

"Wonderful," they nod regarding drinks, moving to stand. "How do you take your whiskey, if at all?"

As he makes his way around the bar and back in speaking distance, he perks up. "And I'd love to hear how you got into your career as well."
||yaoiprincess||Asamis turn to laugh, enjoying the idea of a rich mans plan being foiled with simple science. Justice should always come easily and swiftly, and to that she takes another sip of her drink.

The justice system is just as broken in Japan so I seldom support it but.. its nice to achieve justice. Punish the bad and whatnot. She gently wipes the corners of her mouth. I wish I could snuff such things myself.

Asami looks over at the cabinet once more and wonders who left it unlocked in the first place. I havent had many opportunities to drink myself, it should be fine as long as we dont overdo it. Because a ballerina wobbling around drunk leads to twisted ankles-!
||bananices||They cannot stifle their laugh at the first remark. I cant say Im too passionate about our justice system as it stands. I know thats probably not what I should be saying, but I havent found any wire taps here just yet, they exhale. However most of arson is generally insurance fraud. And a lot of rich men trying to get richer. I like to snuff out their dreams, they say casually.

He tilts his head. I know I should probably be more professional, but every time Ive come here its been locked so Id love to take you up on that.
||yaoiprincess||Asamis eyes follow Etiennes to the liquor cabinet and intrigue slowly creeps in should she drink the night away while its still quiet?

I see, so youre passionate about the justice system or is there some fire major Im not aware of? She points a finger to the liquor cabinet. Do you wish to get more drinks? I heard drunken banter with coworkers can be quite amusing.
||bananices||kill girl kill!!! 

They look surprised, but pleasantly so. Are you kidding? Yours seems way more intriguing to me. His gaze briefly wanders toward the cabinet, unsure of how to gracefully get himself a drink mid-conversation. 

It was a series of events, mostly. I was eligible for full scholarship through a program Id gotten into, and I had to pick from a limited pool of criminal justice things Arson was the most relevant to my interests, they nod.
||yaoiprincess||Im a professional ballet dancer for the Royal Ballet Company. Etienne sees her take a bite but its more like shredding than biting. Though my profession isnt as interesting as yours, what inspired you to walk down that career path?
||bananices||They know the sentiment all too well, sighing. Im an arsons investigator back in France. They seem almost flattered that they could be either of the options suggested. What about you?
||yaoiprincess||Nothing notable but thats to be expected from work. Asami slides her utensils off the plate and begins cutting into her steak. 

Im curious, what is your actual occupation? You have the looks of an author or researcher.
||bananices||"Ah," they nod, as if they get it. "I'm always glad to have company around here." He wobbles the glass in his hand idly.

"They've been fine. Mostly dull and lacking what I seek, but such is the way. And for you?"
||yaoiprincess||Asami merely smirks and shakes her head. Not at all, I was teasing. Eating dinner alone is quite boring though, so I thank you for joining me. 

Asami pours Etienne a glass and gives him a decent glance. Im Asami Koyama, how have events been fairing for you, tienne?
||bananices||They take the question way too seriously, but oblige, taking a glass and sitting beside her. "Oh, was this one? Are you waiting for someone?"
||yaoiprincess||Utensils clink against the plate as Asami gestures towards the empty glasses. Have you ever been on a date before? Grab a glass and sit.
||bananices||Someone has entered the room, and everything normally composed and professional about their demeanor comes to a halt, as they do the opposite, jogging over to the bar.

"The cabinet's open?" They breathe in awe. Clearly someone's been checking...

"Oh, apologies. We haven't been introduced. I'm Etienne." Their gaze settles more on the glass than it does on Asami...
||yaoiprincess||Teleports Asami places her food on a table and walks to the cabinet to pick the lock but the cabit is wide open so she grabs a bottle of wine and sits back down. 

With her posture and meal, Asami looks like shes in an ad for a fancy hotel.

<@357641088208732181>
||aias_||Out!
||aias_||She unlocks the drink cabinet and grabs a lotta drinks.
||aias_||In
||aias_||And now she's in again
||aias_||And now she's not
||aias_||She's here again
||aias_||`...`
||aias_||Ur good, she's no longer in the room 
||aias_||`...`
||aias_||...
"Excuse me for a second."
||aias_||"Oh my. An electrician, a technician and a musician? That's certainly more interesting than what I have to do on a daily basis."

She briefly removes a hand from Junzo's and proudly places it against her chest. "I'm simply a mathematician." She let's out a snort. She's amused by the slant rhymes.

"Well, more precisely, I work as a senior accountant at Goldman Sachs. My days are spent crunching numbers and keeping track of company finances for the most part."
||aias_||She tries to get a view of his eyes, a glimpse into the thoughts of Junzo Ishikawa and yet--her hair got in the way. Tragic.
"Hm. That's what I don't understand. But if it's something that you yourself aren't aware of, there's not anything that can be done. I merely want to be someone that people feel comfortable around is all. Please let me know if I ever make you uncomfortable."

She pulls back from Junzo, though her hands are still imprisoning his. She seems completely unbothered.
"Right, where was I. Oh, I never got to ask you about your profession. What do you do for a living, Junzo?"

She looks genuinely excited to know more about him. Her smile is real.
||aias_||"Well, I was about to ask about what you did for a living. But..."

Baeyo places her hand over Junzo's, effectively sandwiching it in-between her grasp. She tilts her head to the side as her gaze pierces into him. She leans in close to him. Her breath is hot against his cheek. She speaks softly and slowly. 

"...Junzo, are you afraid of something? You've seemed uneasy around me since you've gotten here. Have I perhaps done something to irk you?"
||aias_||She only does the finger gesture if he hadn't followed her to the couch already
||aias_||"Well I didn't drag you here because there was a door here. I'd merely wanted to find a room with a proper sofa."

Baeyo walks over to the couch and sits herself down on the leftmost corner. She tilts her head up towards the ceiling as if to look for something, and after a quick few glances, she refocuses on Junzo and pats the cushion next to her. And smiles.

She gestures him over with her index finger.
||aias_||Anyway with whatever that was aside
||aias_||`. . .`
||aias_||"Hm? Were you tossed out here?" Baeyo squints and stares at the wall. "I was kicked out into the south exit. I'd assumed you had been as well."
||aias_||<@555990109355507712>
||aias_||In!
||aias_||Baeyo drags Junzo like a corpse

||aias_||She walks in! Oh hey the cabinet is open! She didn't get the memo about anything so she just erm....joink!
Takes a bottle of vodka and walks out.
||pulsatilla||He leaves... adios.
||pulsatilla||"I... believe she was fulfilling a task." He shrugs, not at all bothered by this. "I will be taking my leave, my apologies for our intrusion."
||pulsatilla||He looks down at himself. "I think I look good in purple." 
||pulsatilla||
||sadpastry||Callista approaches Yuumi with a deep sigh. Yuumi, you

She takes a deep breath, her eyes water. You are a cruel person. Purple Purple looks *stupid* on you and you.. you have BAD. HANDWRITING. SHE SNIFFLES LOUDLY AND THEN RUNS AWAY. *DO NOT FOLLOW ME I DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU IN PURPLE.* Out with the glasses!
||pulsatilla||He is here... staring at her.
||sadpastry||In here..! She waves to Yuling and Junzo with a hum, sneaking behind the bar to grab some glasses. She waits for Yuumi <@162025912227987457>
||aias_||Oh mb I thought you were just waiting for me to sober up before you dropped some lore on me

Baeyo's already gone
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Ok what do u wanna do?
||aias_||Okay I'm not drunk anymore
||aias_||Wlka
||sadpastry||And she shall indeed follow, with a quick hop and a, Huzzah!!
||aias_||"Huh. Whelp. Ms. Callista, I'll let you know if I can figure this out. In the e meantime, I'll just rest in my room. You're free to follow."

Baeyo lowers her head gracefully and begins walking towards the exit.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||its made out of metal!
||aias_||Alright
<@&1213006530828566598> before she leaves with her favorite Nurse is there anything specific she could examine about the Latch and Catch
||sadpastry||Oh, of course! Just lead the way and I shall follow. She playfully salutes.
||aias_||"Callista, would you like to come with me to my room? I doubt I can do much here. But I'd love to talk to you about other stuff. At least until we can Bypass t/at lock. "

She grins broadly.
||sadpastry||I can tell! You seemed to have a lot of questions for Kazuo in general. I must admit, I am also curious..

She walks closer. And.. thank you! That means a lot to me.
||aias_||"I'm so glad you're here, Ms. Callista.Ill figure this out later. I'm so curious what down there..."

She squints at the secret entrance...
||sadpastry||Its okay ~~Aias~~ Miss Baeyo! I am just happy to be here with you. 
||sadpastry||LMFAO
||aias_||part
||aias_||She doesn't say the first oart
||aias_||"Well shit. Aias is incapable of solving this right now, my apologies Ms. Callista "
||sadpastry||Callista spins

||aias_||Damn...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||lets wait till your sober
||aias_||Bon I'm really drubk what does that look like
||maamthatsafederaloffense||its like a latch and catch
||aias_||Is it a classic combination lock? Cab Baeyo reach it in the space she's pulled out with that strength pull?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||i wont telly ou

||maamthatsafederaloffense||iys like on the other side of the wall
||aias_||Is it on the exterior
||sadpastry||Oh, drats. :(
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Baeyo tugs really hard on the wall and it comes out a little but- it seems there's something bolting it from going any further... unless someone somehow removes the like, its like a hotel security lock.
||aias_||18!!!

||aias_||Can Baeyo pry it open?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||its like a wall and a thin thin seam
||aias_||<@305913481113239552> is there a lock or some kind of handle? An opening mechanism?
||aias_||Baeyo high fives Callista. She's clearly distracted though.
She's squinting at the door.
||sadpastry||Oh, wow, we are so smart!! She holds her hand to high five Baeyo. Waving to Kazuo with her other hand!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yay! I'm glad you haven't lost how to count. Considering. Ok bye!" Hes shutting it
||aias_||"Nine."
||sadpastry||:D!!!!!!
||sadpastry||NINE!!!!!!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"What comes after 8?"
||sadpastry||.Oh! Oh!!!! *EIGHT.*
||aias_||"There are more floors above the other one, correct?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"What comes after 7?"
||aias_||Baeyo takes this opportunity to ask one of her burning questions.
"Mr. Nishiji, what's above floor 7?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Craaazy, I know right? I''l let you know then, but till then, catch you cool cats later." He is slowly closing the door.
||sadpastry||*crazy..*
||aias_||"...What?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I do, for now. There's places where you'd get more than splinter, I don't a star employee getting hurt on the job~"
||aias_||"Hey Boss, you wouldn't mind if I check this out do you?"
She's motioning to the hidden wall door.
||sadpastry||Callista just stares for a second. Oh. Apologies.

She cant fight his ass on this shes scared.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I'm shy..." he says, in the like the worst actor's vvoice possible. It's flat, flatter than paper. He is looking llike though, he is REALLY trying to sell it. However, he still has that resting smile on his face.
||sadpastry||Thanks again. I am good, um But.. Why the wall entrance? She also peeks at Baeyo to see if she has anything to say.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Hey, nice catch!" he gives her a thumbs up. "Well, if you don't need me, I'll head out.
||sadpastry||`[20]` She catches that shit without breaking eye contact with one hand. Cool, for once in her life

..Thank you.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Howdy."
||aias_||Baeyo looks unfazed.
"Hello, Mr. Nishiji"

She waves.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Think fast!" he tosses her comm at her. I mean u can roll to catch it if you want
||sadpastry||She YELPS. And then awkwardly laughs and returns the finger guns. 

Ahahaha ohhh, *yooouuuu.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||You both avoidKazuo? Opening the inner door outward. 

There you are! He points at Callista with finger guns. <@901984511892553739> <@248897197935034378>
||aias_||//sorry if I'm a lil slow to respond to things here but I'll try to keep up

||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> <@901984511892553739>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||It rumbles. Hey WATCHBOUT roll dex!
||sadpastry||Callista follows behind her..
||aias_||Baeyo's gonna walk over to the wall...
||aias_||Baeyo turns....
||sadpastry||Her eyes widen. She slowly turns to face the creak
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> <@901984511892553739> You hear a creak from the wall
||sadpastry||Ah, thank you! It is I really mean to say, *uh* She awkwardly drums her fingers along her glass, trying her damnedest to think of the right word.

AURA. Yes! Sparkle is aura.

She seems proud of herself again, only to immediately deflate once again. No. And I did not ask either, I was.. occupied with something more important.
||aias_||Baeyo is forever going to refer to anything weird Yuumi does as his sparkle. She finds this very amusing.

"Pfft. His *sparkle* you say? I like that. Hehe."

She tilts her head slightly.
"Did Mr. Nishiji not specify when it'd be returned to you?"
||sadpastry||Oh, that? Callista smiles warmly at the memory, He just.. had something really good to tell me. I do not wish to embarrass him by disclosing details, but his seriousness was simply.. Yuumis sparkle! Yes? <a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177> 

She takes another sip, glancing down at the vodka bottle with a short snort. It just looked silly, but Callista knew she couldnt really do better. Damn apron/dress combo

And that *is* a win! I just want my device back soon, as it was the main way people let me knew if they were injured. A soft, remorseful sigh spills from her.. Oh, that shall be such trouble..
||aias_||She finds her pride to be endearing. She lets out a chuckle.
"Heh. Well seeing as Mr. Akiara knew to call you later, I'd consider that a win."

"Speaking of, did everything go alright with him? He seemed quite serious he called your room earlier."

She takes another sip of her drink. She pockets the vodka bottle into one of her pockets. It slightly protrudes awkwardly.
||sadpastry||That did not stop me! I messaged Yuumi *riiiight* before it happened! She puffs her chest out a little, proud! ..But he still took it, so Im not exactly sure if we could call that a success.

Something that *was* good was her being okay. Physically unscathed..

She smiles tighter now, sipping her drink with a hum, I do not mind at all. I still have some bottles in my room from my party. I understand entirely! <:thingy:1036764144390656121>
||aias_||"Oho? Mn. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that Mr. Nishiji would be swooping up to gather the communication devices. I'm sure he doesn't want things to escalate by messaging people mid punishment."

Baeyo swirls her glass again and takes a large sip. "I'm glad you're alright as well, Ms. Callista."
She lightly kicks the cabinet door closed. Not before reaching in and pulling out a bottle of Vodka. She winks at Callista (invisible) and sets it atop the bar counter.

"...Don't mind this, it's just a treat for later."
||sadpastry||Callista accepts the glass, but merely holds it closer to herself with both hands. Not drinking anything *just yet.* She seems a little surprised with the worry directed to her little trio shes found herself in, but its not.. all that shocking after she thinks about it.

Well, I can see all of that. I apologize for the worry, but I assure you we are all okay. I *did* get my device taken away though, so that is why I have been out of contact. I am sorry about that!!

She inhales a little, And I understand. We are okay. I made certain of such. Your concern is.. It makes me glad. Thank you.
||aias_||Baeyo smiles and pours Callista a glass and gently hands it over to her. "...Well of course I have other concerns. The fact that we can't leave is obviously a concern. I'm also concerned about you, Dante and Yuumi. You all got taken by Kazuo and I wasn't able to reach you for a while. I just want to make sure my coworkers are safe."

She pinches her beer glass between her fingers and sways it around in a circular motion. She sees her reflection refracted against the liquid and the icecubes. It seems like she is a bit enamored by her own reflection.
"Oh, I was just down opening the cabinet is all. Nothing too interesting."
||sadpastry||Sure, I shall accept a drink! Callista smiles and approaches the bar, holding out her gloved hand.

I am glad to hear your concussion is better, but do not forget it will take.. another week or so for you to fully heal. Keep taking care of yourself!

Her free hand awkwardly drums on the other side of the bar, And I would not.. worry so much. I do not think the game shall end like a punishment would, or at least I would hope not. I just wish to get rid of everything so we can all move on and continue working! 

Theres a moment of hesitance, but her curiosity overpowers her, Are you certain it is *just* the card game making you worry? And what were you doing under the bar? Apologies, Im just a bit interested.
||aias_||Baeyo pops up holding two beers.
"Ms. Callista, would you like a drink?"
<@901984511892553739>
||aias_||"I appreciate your concern, Ms. Callista, but I believe I'm doing well. The concussion has largely faded for the most part."

She pauses and looks down at her hands.

"...I'm merely concerned about the possibility of failure. With the game, in particular. I had to deal with my punishment and then I was put out of commission for several days. I'd... I don't want to receive any more punishments if I can avoid it. I don't want to be stuck in the final two."

She suddenly dips back down behind the bar. "Hold on, Ms. Callista, give me just a second."
||sadpastry||*HA.* Cards. Callista's eye almost twitches again, but she just continues to meekly smile. Staying in her place by the door for now.

"Ah, I see! I just lost to Asami mere moments ago, so... I have not been having the best luck in terms of finding pairs either. I did not think that many other cards.. existed. Wow!" She's genuinely surprised.

... She steps closer into the room, "Are you well, Baeyo? Is something occuring?"
||sadpastry||[14 :3]
||aias_||Baeyo peeks her head up above the bar.

"My, if it isn't Ms. Callista. Hello there~" Baeyo stands up and places her hands facedown on the counter.  She smirks and nods towards the nurse. "I'm looking for cards, actually. The game won't end until they're all paired up and I have a single one left."

[Roll perception.]
||aias_||Wow omg normal Callista
||sadpastry||shes so normal
||aias_||(6)
||sadpastry||POOF. Callista is here, only fuming a little bit as she pockets her cards into her aprons. u can roll perception....

"...Oh!! Miss Baeyo, hello!!" She stands by the door, slightly surprised, "What are you doing?" :O
||aias_||She's currently behind the bar looking at a thing....
||aias_||She's here!

||maamthatsafederaloffense||THATS WHY I WAS CONFUSED
||maamthatsafederaloffense||READ THIS AS PERC AS PERCOCET I WAS SO CONFUSED
||starzono||`Perception: 14, no perceiving for him`

He stopped screaming but he is breathing so very heavily. He does not Fucking UNDERSTAND. WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!?!??!?
He was following though because he's so damn concerned and scared for Theri. Oh GOD.
||frooztiez||Team Stevie is doing great!!! someone please call their shared parent.
``[OVERCOME EMOTIONS: 9]`` With what little mental control she has, she'll slowly try to right herself onto her feet. She's positively *gushing* with blood, the glass fell at an odd angle, and... yeaaah.....

His screaming doesn't help. ``[OVERCOME EMOTIONS: -1]`` She almost crumples back to the ground once more, staying just on her feet. Her hands are clamped over her ears, and her eyes are shut tight. She's just going to blindly walk and hope that she exits the room.

He can roll a **PERCEPTION** if he'd like! DC is like 18 cause of his screeching.

``[NAVIGATION: NATURAL 20 - 3]`` She... makes it out of the room? Blind and deaf?? ...damn... fortnite really paying off. To the <#1208948110752227328> !!! she needs a medic.
||starzono||Oh god. Oh GOD. WHAT DOES HE DO. WHAT DOES HE DO. OH GOD.
"Who-- Who do I even contact?!?!?! 911 does NOT work apparently!!"
He is trying so hard not to panic but.
`Composure: nat 1`
"WHAT DO I DO HERE?!??!? WHAT DO I **DO**. AAAAAAAAAAAAA??????"
||frooztiez||"oughhuhouhoghoh.hgoj................" ghmhhm iiit hurt........ 
She probably needs medical attention, especially with all of that blood coming out of her skull! Or maybe the hoodie just makes it look worse than it is?? Who knows! Theri doesn't!

Her hands meekly come up to try and hold her head, but she yelps as soon as she touches it. There's no (big) pieces of glass sticking out of her cranium!! That's good!!
"hththte.r'es.... aaaaaa coomPUTER.......... in rodnyes..... withg.h. seecerte.s..............."
She is fully balled up, no hand is grabbed! yewouchy mode....
||starzono||OH GOD. OH NO.
"Do you need medical attention?!?!?! If so, I cannot provide that!!!"

He is so concerned.
"What in the world did you lie about??? Oh gosh--"
He is going to at least going to move the pillows and offer her a hand.
||frooztiez||``[2]``
She walks directly into the doorway and the glass lands on her head and shatters.

``[OVERCOME EMOTIONS: 0]`` She immediately crumples to the floor, defeated by the fruity drink. Now, she is within her cushioned tomb.... "oguhhoug........hoguho.iii............lllliiED...........hg.hmh.............."
||starzono||Valmont has absolutely no idea what Theri just said. He just stared at her for a moment, visibly confused. Blink blink.

...
"Are. Are you alright, mademoiselle?? Do you need anything...?"
||frooztiez||``[14]`` Surprisingly, she's doing alright balance-wise, placing shaky step after shaky step forwards. she will build her pillow fort.... she will amass a collection of pillows in her room and she will be GOD.

",.u..,u..u,,.,um...,,i,imu..uumm.,.,....//../???" Theri has no idea how to lie her way out of this situation. ".m,.,.,.,nnnnnnnoo../?"" Suddenly, her heart hurts!!! '"..hhjj..m..nno..noo......................................nonoo....noo....nono.................nooooooo................"
Great lying there, Theri.
||starzono||"Oh dear-- Be careful! Do not trip!!"
Helpful advice Valmont.

He couldn't help but notice her getting further away. He's slowly approaching her. Will he follow? Who knows....
"That is good!! I like it too!! So many fun things in there!! Have you found anything fun there??"
||frooztiez||``[13]`` She *almost* trips over herself as she tries to reach the door, but alas her shoes are too busy being tied...

"....yyyeaaah,...." The entirely unmedicated Theri has a different opinion, but she will not share it because she knows it is wrong. it's her dirty pleasure opinion

"ttthhANKK--" She *almost* trips again, steadying herself juuust before flinging her drink all over Thomas. With shaky knees, she just stands still for a second. "...................................................."

She's like.... 3/4ths the way to the door. "i.... uum.... i like.... rodneys....." She will NOT reveal her escapades within Rodneys... they are her secrets....
||starzono||"Drugs can be bad, yes! However, some are good! Like just normal medication! Woo! Yes!!!!"
He is so smart. Prescriptions are good!!
"Also, you are so good at balancing. I can only really balance myself. Not a lot of pillows!! You're great at that!!"

Gasp...
"I have been to Rodneys!!! Not very much. Only a time or two. Did not do much when I was there."
||frooztiez||"yyyeeahh...." Everyone on her team is so bright and bubbly... now Theri's starting to think she's even more of an odd woman out... not the best for the mental.

"juuunzzo...." ...Theri does squint a little at Valmont when they bring up being on drugs, cause... she thinks its kind of believable. She's never met someone with so much positive energy before, it kinda hurts her head a little thinking about it.  "...drugs are... bad..... an they.... kill people..." 

She's balancing the 5 cushions in her arms now, teetering to the left and right but managing to keep them afloat. "...thhomas...." Bartender..... Theri's strictly against alcohol, so it puts a bad taste in her mouth. Not like the drink, which is perched on the top of the 5 cushions haphazardly. At least he's 'very cool'... "....yyyeah.... uumm... lovely...."

As she takes a step towards the door, she'll try her best to keep up the conversation. She's not the most excited for it, at least for her having to add to it (she likes listening, though!), but she'll try her best. It's what Stevie would want!

"........have you been to Rodneys.......................??" her first ever full sentence without a 3 second pause...... she's growing....
||starzono||"I do not want to lose either. We are better than losing, after all! We have got this!"
He gave a firm nod.

"Oh-- That was monsieur Junzo!! We just became friends!! He is so kind and motivational. And *very* cool. I think he thought I was on drugs but I am just my normal self. No drugs are required to be fun and enjoyable!!"
At least for him that's the case.

"And then, the man on the couch is monsieur Thomas!! He is a bartender! Also very cool! He seems very calm and collected and professional. We have not spoken much. But I think he is fun!! And he always calls me a friend!!! Which is also lovely!!"
More nodding!
||frooztiez||"ooooh.... uuum... that's.. good." She's a lot more relieved than her voice lets her be, especially hearing most of them either pass out or leave the room. Slowly, she peeks out of her hut. "....iii don't... wanna loose..."

"...who... was that...?? and..... uuumm.... that..??" She points at the door, and then at Thomas. She's seen them, but only from behind blurry and teary eyes. They look a lot different right now.

She'll pick her drink up, and take a little sip with both hands. oh god i dont drink tequila it tastes good though she enjoys it. She'll start gathering up the cushions as well, gently placing the blanket on top of Thomas because she thinks he might need it a little more than she does right now.
||starzono||"Thank you so very much, monsieur Thomas!!!!"
He beamed towards him. Drink time!!!

He then looked to Theri, nodding for a moment.
"So close!! I am Valmont!!"
No big introduction this time. He is holding a drink in a glass.
"I think! We are winning!!!! I've been playing and doing so well. I hope we are winning at least.

And then Valmont turned to Junzo.
"Oh!!! Yes, yes, not a problem! We shall definitely continue whimsy lessons. Just message me and we can continue them!!! Woo!!!!"

> <@555990109355507712> <@373652537024315392>
||frooztiez||"............................uuumm....." This one must be the.... the one that started with a V.... Valkyrie...??? she doesn't remember.. ".............are..... are we winning....?? ii haven't.... really... played the.... ggggamme...." Now she's just a little bit *more* anxious, revealing her WEAKNESS.......
||starzono||He would glance over with the mention of Stevie's team. Gasp!!
"That is my team!!!! Woo! Go us!!!"
He pumped a fist in the air. Cheerleading! He is so good at that.
||frooztiez||".........................uumm...uuhhh...." She doesn't really know how to get Valmont's attention, she's never been good at that... but valmont is on her team..............

.........and she also doesn't know their name.... "uuuuuuuuuuuuummmm.... hhhelloooo....??" she has question.... "..aaare... you.... are ouy... on ........... s..stevie's.. tea,..m..?"
||starzono||"You are doing so amazing, monsieur Thomas."
He's barely started.
||frooztiez||"............................................   ....................."

Part of her fort falls down onto her. She doesn't bother fixing it.
||frooztiez||"....................." She's off in her fort, but they could probably just barely make out one of her eyes peeking back at them.... el gatito aura....
||starzono||"In any case, I could really go for anything. Maybe a tinge strong. Just a tinge. A smidgen, if you will?"
He really doesn't know what he's asking for so he takes a moment to pause and think.

"...The best to offer instead. If that is easier."
Yep. That makes much better sense.
||frooztiez||"uuumhmm....................... oookkayuy...." She genuinely thinks she cannot say no or the sniper will get her the 69 sniper....
||frooztiez||damn....

"..........nnooo...... uumm........ alcohol is.............. evil and it............... kills people...... uuummmmmm...." She's gonna crouch down and slowly try to re-enter her fort.
||starzono||`Perception: 14....damn....`

"Very good, I invited my friend over-- See!! Monsieur Junzo!!! That is my new friend!!!!!"
Nod nod. Very exciting stuff here.

"We are going to have.... The funnest of fun. Very much so. You are free to join, mademoiselle!!"
||frooztiez||Theri thinks its kind of a mid fort, to be honest, but now that she's being gassed up she's starting to think it's a little bit better than she thought. Now she's wondering if she's allowed to bring the cushions up to her room...

Drinks? Theri's drank before.... but it was like once and it was one beer and she hated it. ...but... uuuh... She'll just remain quiet for now, looking back to her lovely fort every so often and wondering if she's allowed to go back inside yet.

"......oo...kay.... hhhavveeee fffunn.... ummm...." oohgghhg ffUCK there's another person- her stature immediately goes from pure slouch to pure STRAIGHT. PERFECT FORM.

also for <@298976980307542016> and <@272423756809371670> , roll..... perception...... dc is ....... 16.......................................................................................
||starzono||"Wonderful!!! Very good fort! I give it, eleven out of ten! Looks stable!!!"
Nod nod. That makes perfect sense.

"But, yes!! Monsieur Thomas is going to be making a drink or two for me-- By the way, are they able to be to-go? Or I bring the glasses back? Is that a possibility?"
He wants to drink with his new best friend Junzo after all and is well aware he is banned from the establishment. At least, that's what Valmont understood.

<@298976980307542016>
||frooztiez||ouhghh and they're *frieendly....* she slowly crawls out of her fortress, standing up to her 4'11 stature, but she's slouched so it's more like 4'9.

".................i........... did.......... um....... thank youuo........" She turns to look back at Fort TheriusMcTheri, which is just made up of five couch cushions, and a blanket from her room draped over the top of them. To be honest, she'd wanted to see if she could sleep in here, but alas the door did not lock, so she just sat.

"......................ffunn........ timee??" She doesn't know what that means, at least not the context that these two have for it. it could be CRIME.
<@298976980307542016>
||starzono||Valmont first turned to Thomas with an excited nod. Huzzah!
"Haha, wow, it's almost like, it magically appeared~"

And then he saw Theri peek out.
"Hello there, mademoiselle!! Did you build the fort?? It is wonderful!!"
He would wave to her with a bright smile.
||frooztiez||Theri *really* doesn't want to come out, enjoying her private area of total darkness. It was either this or her closet, but she sleeps in there... and it's also not spacious... but now there are people......

Covered in her hoodie, she peeks her head out of the fort, unsure if she's about to get stabbed 28 times or not. She's dead quiet, looking between the two newcomers with anxious, baited breath.
||starzono||He would be entering before too long as well. Yippee!!!!
"Greetings, monsieur Thomas!!!--"
.
"When was a pillow fort constructed in here? It looks very cozy!!!"
A man can appreciate a good pillow fort.
||frooztiez||"........................................................................................n..........oo................??" She prays that this works.
||frooztiez||she is here now... making a pillow fort..... and she turned the lights off in the room.....
||bellboy||*Citrus doesn't wave back. He leaves !*
||bellboy||*Citrus looks at his well kept nails, smiling as he said his piece.* " Hmm...I suppose I prefer my dogs to be useful but that's just me. Mine can manage himself without me. He's a good boy. As for what I said before..."

*His eyes remain fixed to his nails, analyzing every fiber and non-existent imperfection. Well kept hands meant very little work done by them. From what aspen knows, Citrus was capable of handling himself. Protecting himself. Doing anything really, yet others always seemed to do it for him whether he asked or not. This entire mall even accommodated him in many ways. Truly, his grip on this place and the people within was a strong one despite being in a simple management position.  He had many "dogs" and saw aspen as just another despite being a "trainer."* "If you're scared of some teeth, then you've already lost. " *He finishes his juice and leaves it on the countertop.* " Don't let trash outshine a diamond, Aspen. I do hope you've made some pairs during old maid. The game is almost done and you'll find the points that come from them to be quite useful. " 

*He makes strides towards the room's exit.* " I enjoyed our talk. Perhaps we'll stumble upon each other again. "
||bellboy||*Citrus leans forward to look at what seemed to be a mere mirror of himself.  Aspen. He was a mirror but not one that replicated him exactly. He warped and bended his reflection but there was still some sort of resemblance.*

*Admittedly, the resemblance annoyed him but the imperfections were too clear. There was only one him and it would stay that way until he ceases to exist.* " Is it not embarrassing for him to ruin your reputation by proxy ? At some point you'll have to choose yourself or him. Eventually he'll screw up so badly you'll have to put him down. Is that something you're okay with ? "
||bellboy||*Citrus brings a hand to his chin. His fingers gently press on his lips as he takes in every drop of info from the words to to Aspen's body language.* " Desjardins, do you hope to gain my approval by insulting your "friend" or are you genuinely struggling to train him ? "
||bellboy||*His legs cross as he listens with interest. It's not every day someone describes their long-term friend as a dog. That smile of his makes him assume that this jab is a playful one but he can't help but hope there was more to it.* " A dog, huh ? In what way ? A stray ? He seems to lack any sort of obedience. "
||bellboy||" Oh ! *Ishikawa.* " *He giggled at the name and overall thought of the person.* " He's quite the personality, Isn't he ? Quite the sore loser that one. " *He taps the body of his glass.* " I'm assuming you know him well since you assumed that I would care about the status of his impulsivity. Does he always behave like a child without parental guidance ? "
||bellboy||*His curiosity is peaked. He has no clue as to who he's referring to. He leans back and turns to face aspen completely.* " And who might that be ? You lot are riddled with impulsive individuals. "
||bellboy||" Hmm...." *He looks only mildly disappointed by the answer.* " I also enjoy drinking despite my quickness in losing sobriety. " *Siiiiip.* " Are you often impulsive, Desjardins ? "
||bellboy||*Citrus raises a brow. He looks Aspen up and down before breathing out a chuckle.* " You've got working hands don't you ? " *He wasn't about to serve anyone.*

*He took another judgmental sip of his juice, glancing over at Aspen with a thin smile.* " For what reason would you need to get drunk ? "
||bellboy||MY BAD
||bellboy||*Citrus freezes.*

" ... "

*He sips again.*

" *apple juice.* " *He wasn't going to lie about it. Being found out is for people who desire humiliation. It is best for him to out himself instead.* " Getting drunk in the morning is a waste of the day. "
||bellboy||*His stare goes a thousand miles but is abruptly stopped by the stop sign of sudden presence. He blinks and turns to face him.* " Hmmm ~ Looks like you and I thought the same thing. " *His fingers trace the rim of of his glass. He is definitely pretending it's whiskey.* " What brings you here so early in the day ? "
||bellboy||*Teleportation ! Citrus is out of his room...*

*He looks around....neither Thomas nor Kali are here to make him something.....*

*.....*

*He takes on mixing a drink himself. He preps a whiskey glass for an old fashioned, using one of kali's pre-sculpted ice diamonds for some extra flare. He then proceeds to pour the world's finest.....apple juice into the glass. Looks like whiskey I guess.*

*Everything is put away neatly as if no one had touched a single thing ! He scurries around the counter and sips on his juice, kinda spacing out in thought.*

<@741816012923600977>
||starzono||We outta here!
||snombi||Shufflee...
||starzono||Time to look elsewhere!! He would spin over to join her at the exit, ready to go!
||snombi||She nods. No use chilling out here any longer. She shuffles over to the exit, patiently waiting for him to join her.
||starzono||"Hm... In that case, shall we look elsewhere?"
||snombi||"Mmnn.. No such.. luck.." She responds. "I.. I don't think.. there's anymore.. cards here.. actually.."
||starzono||"...Maybe this is a common place to check? I am not finding anything. You?"
||starzono||Dang....
||snombi||WEH!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||No more cards in this room 
||snombi||Hmm.. She thinks the mini-bar would be a good place to start. Soraya looks on top of and below the mini bar in search for cards.. <@&1213006530828566598>
||starzono||"Yes!!! We should start here! Now, where to look, where to look indeed..."
||snombi||"We.. could start, um.. h..here, if.. if that's.. the case.." May as well, right? Off to a good start.
||starzono||"Alright!! So, where are we looking first? Here? I have been here and I've not been searching for cards. So, there might be some!!"
||snombi||Was she really? She looks down and holds her hands together once more. She didn't know if she'd call herself *that*.. "O..Oh.. Okay.." <:littleshy:877717482960478228>
||starzono||Gasp!!!! He nodded.
"Yes!!! That is what we shall do!! You are a genius, mademoiselle!!"
||snombi||Hopefully she won't have another falling down the stairs situation. She wonders if there were any in here. "M..Mmhmm.." She slowly nods. "And.. ma..maybe.. we.. we can.. tr.. trade.."
||starzono||"Of course!! Not a problem, mon amie!!"

He was surprised to hear that, mostly because he forgot he should look around for those.
"Oh!!! Yes!! Looking for cards!! I need to do that as well! Would you like to look together?"
||snombi||"Oh.. i..is it..?" She's surprised to hear that, yet again taken aback by people's kindness. "..Th..thank you.. Mr. Chaput.."

Moving along though, she was hoping to maybe find more cards. "Ah, um.. I.. I wanted.. t..to.. get.. c..cards.." She says quietly.
||starzono||That is incredible to hear!! I am so glad that you are feeling better. I was worried you were not doing alright, but, seeing you here is fantastic!!
He gave a nod and a confident smile.
Now, what are you doing here today?
||snombi||"Eeee.." She looks down, ashamed she even messed up before she even properly started speaking coherently. She fiddles with her fingers. "..A..aah.. ye.. yes.. Th..Thank you, Mmm.. Mr.. Chaput.."
||starzono||He was just shifting things about, mostly just mindlessly. Maybe theres more than he thought could be in here. Or maybe he is just bored. Or even both! How silly.
But, he looked up with hearing Sorays, smiling towards her.
Mademoiselle Soraya!! Hello!! How are you doing? Are you feeling better?
||snombi||Something totally weird didn't happen here a bit ago, right? She steps in, not having been in here for a bit herself. The last time she was- 

She's distracted by Valmont being in here. She spots him almost immediately.

"..H..He..he...e-" She can't even get it out fully. She stops and looks at him awkwardly.
||starzono||Aaaaand he is here again <3
Who knows what machinations lay here before he entered earlier. Right now? He is chilling. So silly!

||sadpastry||I AM SORRY! YUUMI PLEASE WAIT, I WAS CURIOUS. <:awwww:1158234237296709684>
||pulsatilla||GIRL BYE. HE'S WALKING AWEAY.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi is whispering to Callista and texting at the same time.
||elainatime||Okay, thank you. Xavier says weakly. He pushes himself to his feet and starts making his way to the elevator.
||yaoiprincess||Asami stands up slowly. Lets take you to your room to rest. Your day has been very laborious.
||elainatime||Yeah, okay. Xavier is overcome with tiredness. He slumps over. I want to Lay down. Can we go, like, to someones room or something?
||sadpastry||AND NOW YUUMI.
||sadpastry||Callista just gently places it over his nose bridge before cupping his face, smiling warmly. It is no hastle, sweetheart. I adore you! Be careful, yes?
||pulsatilla||He's getting up, shuffling over to Callista to whisper to her.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi's been texting the whole time, he very slowly starts to melt into the couch... ohhg... many things going on in his head.
||elainatime||Xavier looks at it. "Yes. Thank you Callista. You're so nice..." His eyes start tearing up again.
||sadpastry||She whips out a Finding Nemo one. Is this one acceptable? :D
||yaoiprincess||Im aware but its still something good to avoid for a while She rubs her head. Sleepover punches and Drinking punches. Are we turning into barbarians shes mumbling a bunch of stuff about proper workplace behavior.
||elainatime||"This is kind of a weird question but... Do you have any fun band-aids? I know it's kind of stupid but. I like them."
||sadpastry||Xavier, let me put a bandaid over your nose so you remember not to touch it. You cant exactly brace broken noses, so give it a few months. Smile! And she gets the bandaid ready to smack over the bridge of his nose.
||elainatime||"I'm not even drunk..." Xavier protests.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi looks over at Callista, gesturing her over.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks at Xavier and claps her hands together. Lets all make a pledge to never drink again. 
||sadpastry||Callista blows a kiss to Dante!
||yaoiprincess||Im only making a request in case something does occur. She shakes her head and sighs.
||yaoiprincess||Asami thinks about Dantes mangled fist and cringes a little.
||yaoiprincess||I do have to ask you not to start a fight, after your first with Baeyo Im concerned for your body.
||elainatime||Xavier looks concerned. "Be careful! And, um. Will you make sure Aspen is, like, okay? And safe?" He's looking at Dante with big puppy eyes. (Charisma: 13)
||sadpastry||Wow the smiths.
||elainatime||Xavier's eyes light up. "Yeah!!-" He winces. "Ow."
||yaoiprincess||Asami just sits there blankly. Shes trying to juggle the newfound knowledge of Xavier getting punched and Rage Cage.
||elainatime||"Um. There's like cups, and ping pong balls, and you try to bounce the ping pong ball into the cup before the person to your left does it, and if they do it then you have to like, take a cup of beer from the middle of the table and drink it.... and there's like more rules too but it's like really fun. Um."
||elainatime||Callista thinks Xavier looks like her favorite celebrity! I'll dm others
||sadpastry||she sees all
||sadpastry||-2!
||yaoiprincess||`12`
||elainatime||"It's a drinking game. It's awesome." Xavier sniffs again.
||sadpastry||I was just about to say that!
||elainatime||roll perception
||elainatime||"Um. I wanted to play a game of rage cage, because I wanted to drink more and I like rage cage. And then, everybody was being kind of weird, and acting super concerned about me? Like they thought I was, like, drunk and not able to control myself or something. And I kept saying that I was fine, and finally I convinced them to play the game, so I came in here and started setting up, and then I noticed that Junzo and Aspen weren't following me, so I started to come out, to come like, get them, but then I saw that Junzo was like holding Aspen's wrist, and it looked like he was gripping it, like, super tight. And then I heard Junzo say that he was going to beat the shit out of me, so I didn't say anything, and I came back in. I told Thomas what Junzo said and asked if I could have a bottle of wine just in case Junzo did try to beat me up. And Thomas didn't believe me. So then they came in, and I thought that maybe it was all fine and he maybe was like talking about somebody else and I just misinterpretted it or something, and then when I thought Aspen was looking, like, really drunk, so I asked him if he wanted me or Junzo to drink for him, so he wouldn't have to, because it looked like he still wanted to play the game, and then Junzo came up to me and punched me in the face."
||elainatime||Xavier sniffs. "Um, like only a few days? I met him after I met... All of you."
||yaoiprincess||Xavier. Asami glances towards him with a frown, she shakes her head.
||sadpastry||:3
||sadpastry||(13)
||yaoiprincess||[NAT 20 (15)]
||yaoiprincess||Asami rubs her face and just sighs.
||elainatime||roll perception!
||elainatime||"Yeah... I had a bad day... Wanted to relax... But I only had two drinks."
||yaoiprincess||Asami rubs her head migraine Please do not stress out Thomas, lets all just converse peacefully.
||elainatime||"What did I do?" He turns to Thomas. "What did I say? I just wanted to know if Aspen wanted Junzo or I to drink for him in rage cage! And then he fucking punched me!"
||pulsatilla||Yuumi stands up from the bar, he takes a seat within the lounge, chilling.
||yaoiprincess||Im sure whatever happened will blow over by next morning, its important that Xavier takes some time to sober up.
||sadpastry||Callista is just awkwardly waiting for Xavier to be done so she can keep treating him.
||elainatime||Between sobs, Xavier chokes out. "I thought- we were- friends..."
||elainatime||Xavier clings onto Dante, pressing his face against Dante's leg.
||elainatime||Xavier's crying is one hundred percent genuine. He's in so much pain - emotional and physical. He's past the point of being able to compose himself, even if he wanted to.
||yaoiprincess||She nods and sits in front of Thomas with a worried frown. Are you alright Oh- she turns to Xavier.
||sadpastry||Shes patting Xaviers shoulders. Looking between him and Dante.
||sadpastry||Its okay, love, you did so good! It is over!
||elainatime||"He just punched me" Xavier is crying hard. "And all I wanted." More sobbing. "Was for us to play a game and all be friends."
||yaoiprincess||Oh my goodness. She looks at Dante then at Thomas again. What happened to looking for Xavier?
||elainatime||Between the pain of his nose setting and the relief of seeing Dante, Xavier starts to sob freely.
||sadpastry||It is okay! You did great! You are good! Put this to your nose, you might bleed. With the gauze held up.
||sadpastry||`MED 13` Callista snaps his nose into place. Its straight now! But it probably hurts. Shes reaching into her medkit already for gauze and a bandaid.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||yuumi, onme of these bottle labels are not like the other. but u cant remember which one, roll  a d100
||pulsatilla||`13`
||elainatime||"What? *No!* I just wanted to play a drinking game..." Xavier looks pitiful.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||roll perception yumi
||yaoiprincess||Asami stands there and then looks at Thomas confused. Pardon me, but why was Xavier punched?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||yuumi is lookimg thru  bottles
||elainatime||"...Yeah." Xavier winces and prepares himself.
||sadpastry||I will text Aspen, do not worry so much. First though! I need to set your nose. Are you ready? She raises her gloved hands and cups his face.
||elainatime||Xavier's eyes open wide. "I mean, he wasn't hurt when he *left* but..." He looks at Callista with concern.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi is lookin' thru the cabinets, yeehaw!
||sadpastry||
||sadpastry||JJSJSJDKKEKF
||.wozwald.||oh no... xavier is about to experience BULK STRENGTH
||elainatime||It is crooked and needs setting.
||sadpastry||WARM BEER IS WILD
||maamthatsafederaloffense||cabniet\
||sadpastry||Aw! Friends, I am so happy my presence makes you thank divinity. That is so kind! She nods, I can check Xaviers nose, yes yes. Come here.

At the mention of Aspen, she frowns. What about Aspen? Is he hurt? She approaches Xavier and stares at his nose, is it crooked? Does she have to set it?
||pulsatilla||The fuck is cucking......... Yuumi takes his phone out.
||elainatime||"Because *Aspen* thinks they're *together*. And Junzo's just cucking him." Xavier sniffs. "I'm honestly kind of worried for Aspen..."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||YES unlels <@298976980307542016> didnt lock it
||pulsatilla||He walks behind the counter, looking down at the locked cabinets. Do they require a key to open? <@&1213006530828566598>
||elainatime||"Oh, thank god." There are tears slowly dripping out of Xavier's eyes. His lip is quivering. "My nose..."
||pulsatilla||Yuumi is  .
||sadpastry||Callista is here with Yuumi! She has her medkit. Hello! I was summoned. 
||elainatime||"Dude, I didn't mean for it to like, escalate like that. I just wanted to play a fucking drinking game and then that *asshole* fucking punched the shit out of me." Xavier takes the ice and holds it against his face.
||elainatime||Hes still typing
||elainatime||It fucking hurts. Xaviers eyes start to water. I think he broke my nose
||elainatime||Xavier takes out his device and starts typing out messages.
||elainatime||What a dick. Xavier sits.
||bellboy||ME RIGHT NOW
||elainatime||Xavier is still rubbing his jaw. He turns to Thomas. Hey, *T*, got any ice in that mini fridge?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||https://tenor.com/view/izfrauds-spongebob-umm-scared-silent-gif-22758028
||elainatime||Xavier is watching Aspen. You gonna go with him? With the guy who just *decked me for no reason?* He seems a little *unstable,* Id be a little scared of what he might *do* to *You!*
||elainatime||Xavier laughs, wiping his nose. Aspen, did you see that? He just fucking decked me! *For no reason*! What a *Gentleman*. He takes a few steps to follow Junzo. Looks like chivalry isnt dead after all!
||elainatime||NOT ME ! NO ! UHH
||maamthatsafederaloffense||are you guys... fighting?
||elainatime||Xavier sees the punch coming but cant get out of the way in time. (Dex: 21) He takes the punch and collapses to the ground, woozy. He holds his hand against his jaw. Thomas- Thomas- I fucking told you man. Xaviers nose is bleeding. He staggers back to his feet and looks at Aspen. You know hes fucking Rhea, right? And like, *eight other people* from what Ive heard. He stands, glaring daggers at Junzo with a light smile on his face.
||elainatime||Xavier turns to Aspen. Then, as if hes talking to a child, his voice absolutely dripping with sweetness. Aspen, who do *you* want to drink for you?
||elainatime||Do *you* want to do it, or should *I*? Xavier smiles sharply. Or you know what? Maybe we should *ask Him!*
||elainatime||What? But its so fun! And Aspen still wants to play without drinking, right Aspen? Xavier shoots a glance at Aspen as he approaches Junzo, standing right in front of him. Why doesnt one of us drink *for* him, Junzo?
||elainatime||Xavier glances nervously from Thomas to Junzo to Aspen before finally landing on Yuling. He holds his gaze on Yuling for a while, finding comfort in looking at him.
||elainatime||The cup in the middle is called the bitch cup. And we fill that one with straight Vodka. ((xaviers rules!)) Whoever loses has to drink it. Theyre the bitch.
||elainatime||In the meantime, Ill explain the rules. Xavier explains the rules of rage cage!! I dont want to type them out :] here are the rules if you dont know. Its actually super fucking fun https://www.chickenshit.games/blog/rage-cage
||elainatime||Xavier looks at Junzo. He sees his grin and relaxes. Im just waiting for Thomas to set up the um. To get the beer. Thomas?
||elainatime||I need you to give me that bottle of wine. Xavier points to the bottle of wine. I promise you, I swear to you, Im not going to drink it. But I just overheard Junzo saying that hes going to *beat the living shit out of me*. And I dont know why.
||elainatime||Xavier pulls his head back in with urgency. Thomas? Thoma- He speed walks up to the bar and grabs Thomas by the shoulders. Thomas, listen to me. He looks dead in Thomass eyes.
||elainatime||Xavier finished setting up cups. Where the fuck is everyone else? He peeks his head out into the south exit.
||elainatime||Xavier walks in and starts setting up a table with red solo cups. We just need some beer and two ping pong balls. If we dont have ping pong balls we can use bottle caps.
||yaoiprincess||She cant get into the cabinet to check so she leaves
||yaoiprincess||She puts the dirty glasses in there!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Dirty dishes
||yaoiprincess||She does a flat Yay and puts it in her pocket. Is there anything in the dish bin?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||In the mini bar, we have the alcohol cabinet, the area on the floor and dish bin 

In the mini bar floor, right WHWRE peoples feet would go, asami finds one card!
||yaoiprincess||She fixes the seating and tries looking in the mini bar, shell check the floor and surfaces, if theres any mats shell lift them up as well
||maamthatsafederaloffense||That area has been searched in every nook and cranny seems that the last cards here are gone
||yaoiprincess||I think the cabinet is locked so shes going to check under the seats and cushions of the seating area
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Well, WHWRE is she looking?

There is the alcohol cabinet, mini bar, and open seating area to inspect
||yaoiprincess||While shes cleaning up the joint <@&1213006530828566598> Are there any cards left in this room?
||yaoiprincess||Asami seems devastated that he locked the cabinet. Her full bottle of white wine Youre very kind, Ill see you later. She waves at them both and decides to start cleaning up.
||yaoiprincess||You both should go check on him, Ill keep the alcohol safe. Asami is eyeing the wine carefully.
||elainatime||Xavier grabs the Mai Tai from Thomas (when hes done). Xaviers face is a little pinker than usual? Um, is anyone else feeling like, its like, kinda hot in here? I think Im gonna like step outside for a minute for some fresh air. Er. Fresher air. He steps out, drink in hand.
||elainatime||Xavier looks super awkward as hes whispering. He glances back at Thomas to see how far hes gotten on the Mai Tai.
||elainatime||Xaviers eyebrows slowly knit themselves together. Then, out loud, What? 
He whispers back to Aspen. Whisper whisper
||elainatime||After taking the shot, he feels Aspen tap his shoulder. 
Yeah? He says, turning around.
||elainatime||Xavier relaxes. Sorry. I didnt mean to, like, unload on you like that Thomas. I really appreciate you looking out for me. Thats. Like. It. You know, it makes you a good bartender. He throws the shot back and shudders. Then he places the shotglass back on the counter. Thanks.
||elainatime||Aside from his generally weird behavior at the moment, Aspen might notice an unusual slight tremor in Xaviers hands, and a jerkiness in his demeanor.
||elainatime||Im sorry. I guess I didnt really make this, like, it like wasnt like, clear. But Im not, like, new to drinking? Im a musician, you know. Ive played guitar at clubs and bars and stuff. People are always bringing you free drinks and shit, so that they can like talk to you or whatever, instead of tipping with money. And my best friend was like, a bartender for a while. So I guess Im trying to say, like, you dont need to be, like, concerned about me? Like, I just want a couple drinks man. Roll perception if you want!
||elainatime||(7) Xavier doesnt catch it. Hes furrowing his eyebrows at Thomas. This man is literally itching for some alcohol right now.
||elainatime||And you literally just handed Aspen, like, 6 shots worth of drinks. Like, I dont want to like, be like, telling you want to do or anything, but like, shouldnt you be, like, more worried about Him?
||elainatime||What? Xavier looks confused. Thomas, I havent had a single drink yet?
||elainatime||Xavier glances at Aspen and then back at Thomas. Thomas, could I actually, like, also have, like, just like a shot please? Of vodka?
||elainatime||Hm Maybe its like, theres something about us? Like maybe we have some genetic mutation that makes us immune to becoming a zombie or like that makes us able to shapeshift or something and so they want to separate us from the other people so they can like study us? And like harvest our genetic material and make clones of us to save the human race or something? And then the whole mall thing is just an elaborate cover up. He snaps back to reality. Um.
||elainatime||Xavier nods along to Thomass explanation. Oh, right. Yeah. I think thats probably, like, a good thing to have right now. Hes eyeing Thomass progress on the Mai Tai. Oh. I thought I like, got here and then forgot about it. Like I thought I chose to be here. I just, like, why would they kidnap *us?* I mean, I dont know about you guys, but I dont, like, have any money or anything.
||yaoiprincess||((OH MAN GOOD LUCK ITS RLLY FUN AND THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ADVICE!!!))
||elainatime||((THATS AWESOME IM DOING SHROOMS AGAIN IN A FEW DAYS I HOPE THEIR TRIP GOES WELL if stuff goes south affirmations usually get it back on track sorry for unsolicited advice <3))
||yaoiprincess||((Ravi is trip sitting a friend pretend Asami is drinking mixer with a straw <3))
||elainatime||Sorry, what does levity mean? Im just, like. You know 
Do you think? We got? Kidnapped?
||elainatime||Um. Yes please. Xavier folds his hands in his lap. Thank you, Thomas. This is, like, really nice of you to do this for us.
||elainatime||Xavier has been sitting and listening. When the conversation lulls, he turns to Thomas. Hey, um, Thomas. If its not like, inconvenient, would you be able to, like, also make me a Mai Tai too? Um. He glances at the drink in Aspens hands. A strong one?
||yaoiprincess||Valmont also recommended Vegas and said it was beautiful, its a shame theres no ballet tours that accept guest dancers this year not that it would make a difference due to well me being here.

Asami taps her fingers on the table and laughs. I wouldnt mind a time to know all your stories, its nice to hear about normal life and jobs. I get a glimpse into what my life couldve been like. I like to envision you living the American dream like the movies. White picket fence and a beautiful family, its interesting. She wrinkles her nose a bit as she thinks. Id like to see those photos too, what a shame.
||yaoiprincess||I fear I have nothing interesting about myself as well besides old childhood stories. Ballet consistently took over my life. She rubs her head and sighs. Unless youre interested in the many horror stories of Ms. Mikhailov and her intense training.
||yaoiprincess||I need to visit America at some point, I hear so many stories and states but I cant quite wrap my head around what its truly like besides Texas? Asami scratches her neck at the memory of consistent cowboy trinkets sold at hobby stores. I cant even imagine you with blonde hair. Youd look like a gyaruo she squints and tries even harder to envision Thomas blonde with a tank top and a million belts.
||yaoiprincess||Whats casual conversation to partake in besides the usual observations in environment? She shrugs and thinks on it. Unless you wish to share stories about our pasts? Asami doesnt want to talk about her life though she just enjoys listening to other people talk double edged sword. Im used to talking about women when I spend time with coworkers I never considered it to be not normal.. hmm
||yaoiprincess||Of course, you have to talk to your bros and insist that they change their ways and respect women properly. You three seem like hardcore women respecters so I know I can entrust you with such tasks. She nods. You could be the anti-misogyny task force.
||yaoiprincess||Yes, were too comfortable calling the women around here babes and bragging about having relations with them. Its not proper etiquette. Shes sitting down in front of Thomas. We must do something about this so theyre respected.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||
||yaoiprincess||Asami returns. We have to clear up misunderstandings about women.
||elainatime||Xavier comes back in. Hes being weird. Hes not looking at Aspen. And responses from elaina will be slow !!
||elainatime||.Yes Xavier whispers to Asami. Whisper whisper..
||yaoiprincess||Asami slides out of her seat and follows Xavier. You have another task already?
||elainatime||I actually! I actually think. Um. That I need to go right now and check on. Um. Like. Um. Like. Um. Xaviers eyes light up! Idea!! This is my task. He goes to walk out, and then turns and says Um, Asami, can I like talk to you for like just like just one second?
||elainatime||Oh dude. Xavier did not sign up for this. Hes thinking about making a run for it Uhm.
||yaoiprincess||Asami stares at them both confused The one topic we have been discussing. You know.
||elainatime||Um? What? 
||yaoiprincess||I believe misunderstandings need clearing up.
||yaoiprincess||In Asami is going to sit in front of Thomas and gesture towards the other two to sit somewhere else.
||starzono||He follows!!!!!
||helminthic||Uno shrugs like he knows that and leads the way to the sixth floor!!!
||starzono||"Is he beating someone up??? Oh boy. That may be troublesome. We shall leave the cups. They are fragile. A genius, you are!"
||helminthic||"Should I grab the cups? I think Dante is beating someone up there. Perhaps we should gather these later..."
||starzono||"Oh, yes!!! Very good!! Stacking is so important. We must do that. You are so smart!!!"
"Though, my hat is with Mirai! I must pick it up at some point. It is often an extension of me. Especially when performing. But!!! I am fine without it~ We may be even, then~ Although, it may become an issue when it comes to magic--"

gASP. He is getting messages on his device. 
"Monsieur Ryuunosuke. There are magical artifacts on the sixth floor. We must go."
||helminthic||Uno thinks for a bit. "I can carry quite a few cups, Vallie... Especially if we stack the ones that can be stacked--" he says, checking his communicator, smiling at it, then looking back up to continue their conversation. 

"Where is your hat, Mr Magician? Do you feel nude without it? 

It'd be like if I wasn't wearing my mask or my gloves if I were you... Although, you did catch me sticking my bare hands in the fountain so...Maintenant, nous sommes quittes, non?"
||bananices||bonjour etc.?
||starzono||> <@233964292213309440>
||starzono||He blinked for a moment. Hm.
"...I change my mind. Three of each. I do not have a bag for gathering things either. This may prove difficult."

Another lightbulb.
"Aha!! We can put some things in my ha--"
He reached for his hat and--
Oh. Right. It. Is not there. He gave it to Mirai for funsies and forgot he wasn't wearing it.
"--aaaaat that is not on my head at the moment. Hm. A predicament indeed..."
||helminthic||Uno does a double take when Valmont says 5 of each. That is a lot of cups, but the cabinets were locked, so like it was fine. Even if they were unlocked if people were so desperate for alcohol they could just swing back the bottle, who gives a fuck. He nods slowly. 

"Riiight... Five of each... That is... well, never mind-- 

Let me help you carry all of those. Where do you want them to go?"
||starzono||Vallie...... His eyes sparkle. A nickname......
"Haha!! Perhaps I should experiment! Maybe I can come up with something very very unique~"
Gears are turning in his head as he is coming up with something. Hmmmmm...

Anyone could practically see the lightbulb "eureka!" moment Valmont had.
"I got it. We must take both types of cups. Five of each."
||helminthic||"There is quite the selection here, Vallie..." Uno says, grabbing two different varieties. "Perhaps you should experiment with them, no?" He is half joking. He really has no idea what things go into a magic trick or magic show so he is just here to give the other the supplies he asked for.
||starzono||"Aha!!! Very good, cups are needed!! I was thinking any cup that you cannot see through, like one made of plastic, for example? However, I can improvise if there are none like that. I am a creative individual, after all!!"
He would skedaddle closer to Uno to check out the cup selection.
||helminthic||Uno gives him a baby wave. A gesture to come closer. "Check this, they have cups... What kind do you need for your show, monsieur?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||any kind u want
||maamthatsafederaloffense||glass
||helminthic||/ see thru
||helminthic||what kinds . are they glass 
||maamthatsafederaloffense||yah
||helminthic||Uno exhales. "Yes, let's see..." he says, walking up to the mini bar then tapping on the surface of it. <@&1213006530828566598> are there cups that are........ up for grabs......
||starzono||Aaaand voila!!! They have arrived!!

"Here we are!! The room with the bar!! Yes!!"
He actually hasn't been in this room, but he remembers it when he was testing doors. Wonderful!
"Now, let us begin the search for the cups!!"
||yaoiprincess||Shes so bored shes going to go back to her room.
||yaoiprincess||Asami sits down and starts playing the pet game on her device.
||sadpastry||bye
||sadpastry||Dante and I make out OH, bye!
||yaoiprincess||..
||sadpastry||`. . .`
||yaoiprincess||Pardon? Asami is staring.
||sadpastry||Oh!!! Yes please. She bats her eyelashes.
||sadpastry||CALLISTA HUSHES ASAMI AND DANTE. Opening her medkit
||sadpastry||..
||yaoiprincess||Oh goodness, did someone leave their pager? Asami gets up with concern.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||not you...
||yaoiprincess||Asami checks her pager.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||not you either...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||it's not hers...
||yaoiprincess||Excuse me? Asami blinks and tilts her head.
||sadpastry||Callista checks her pager.
||sadpastry||
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``Ring Ring Ring`` *A comm walkie talkie is ringing...*
||yaoiprincess||Its alright, I dont use it much and Im still struggling with rest. Itd be nice for someone to get some use out of it. She nods.
||sadpastry||:0 I have never had one! Is that a good thing?
||sadpastry||At my sleepover? I admit, I am so happy that so many people actually slept! I love snuggling. 
||sadpastry||Things are always happening nowadays..

And she gasps! I would not what to intrude! Now I am worried about your sleeping habits though, are you getting any rest at all?
||yaoiprincess||Asami blinks and stares at Dante. She doesnt know what to say about that or the pants.
||yaoiprincess||You may use my room, Im barely in it
||yaoiprincess||So why are you telling us this?
||sadpastry||I do not know.  Perhaps I shall just stay awake, it is okay.
||yaoiprincess||Oh dear Asami is scared for the state of this company and hotel. Where will you sleep?
||sadpastry||Well I do not know, honestly! They simply talked and fell asleep in my bed. Perhaps there was wholesome intent behind it She lifts her hands to try and play with her hair, or rather.. uh, Shes trying to fix it the best she can.
||yaoiprincess||Asami gasps and finally shows her face its completely flushed at this point. Aspen and Xavier are also having relations?
||sadpastry||I felt like I interrupted Aspen and Xavier She mumbles.
||yaoiprincess||Are you absolutely positive? Because youre implying they had coitus in front of Baeyo.
||yaoiprincess||Asami checks her comms device and covers her face to hide her expression. So you interrupted a intimate moment?
||sadpastry||Callista just finished typing on her device, Mirai is very cute in many ways, I would not fault Yuumi if he liked him! But you two are as well. Always! She twirls her hair. Its down right now.
||yaoiprincess||Did you ask if Yuumi had relations?
||yaoiprincess||Asami bows her head in shame.
||yaoiprincess||He always wears pants.
||yaoiprincess||`You notice Asamis eyes shine- or maybe its the lights reflecting off of them with that wide stare of hers. Shes not horrified in the slightest, she seems very happy! Her cheeks are tinted red and her breathing ticks up a bit.`

Thank you, Callista! Ill do my best for you Shes grinning.
||sadpastry||(14)
||yaoiprincess||Roll perception <:lip:1019149869677555762>
||sadpastry||Callistas hands squeeze Asamis. Her smile is bright Shes beaming, I do too! And you are doing just that, never worry about right and wrong with me. Friends forever, gorgeous! Forever! She nods her head affirmingly. Friendship forever
||yaoiprincess||Asami unlaces her fingers and holds Callistas hand with a relieved smile. That makes me so happy to hear, I only wish to do the right thing. She glances down at their hands.

I look forward to being your friend forever.
||sadpastry||Callista gasps softly, a hand pressing to her chest as she listened to Asamis thoughts and feelings. Her brows furrowed and her lips parted slightly, mainly due to surprise.

I have also never experienced a real sleepover But you do not have to apologize! You did nothing wrong, so do not fret. Dante told me that my party was a rager, so there shall be an even better one in a future, but the fact you cared so much brings me so much joy..! Truth be told, I did not truly work that hard..

She shakes her head, holding her gloved hands out subtly for Asamis, I could never think of you differently too! You are someone I genuinely like and trust, so do not worry about me and my feelings towards you. We are friends, no? We shall support eachother forever!
||yaoiprincess||Theres lots of things Asami wishes to discuss, a million tiny memories and feelings she needs to comb through and make sense of. So, she silently plays with her hands to make until she could figure out how to express herself to another person.

I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier, Im not *that wasnt normal for me* and I fear I added onto your stress by letting my anger get the best of me. Fingers lace themselves together to form a flat prayer.

I was looking forward to the sleepover because I never had the chance to experience something like that. It wasnt until I was kidnapped and taken here that I started to make genuine connections. Seeing your hardwork ruined- I saw red The consequence of dedicating herself to ballet at a young age was isolating herself from the normal world before she really lived in it. Ballerina is a career that could be ripped away from her at any moment, she wanted to dance at every opportunity to make the most of it- but the cost came back to bite her.

I dont want you to think of me differently, I also wish to be someone you can reach out to without any worry. Ive been told that Im a work in progress and I want this to be another step forward for us by helping you understand me.
||sadpastry||She sits down next to Asami, hands folded in her lap. Callistas hair is down, but everything else is the same. So! What did you wish to discuss?
||yaoiprincess||Asami is here! I dont know who else is here but she leads Callista to one of the couches and politely sits down. Shes freshly changed so no more homeless look.
||sadpastry||Callista walks in!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Mayhem busy at work,,, cant rp work,,,
||maamthatsafederaloffense||DAMN
||aias_||Waves! She gestures to her favorite Boy Fail.
"And I'll talk to you, Junzo....later."
And she's out!
||aias_||"Likewise. I'll see you when I see you, Aspen." She waves
||aias_||"I'm afraid I have something to attend to at the moment. I'll check back in if you're still here in a bit. Thank you again for the drink, Thomas. And for the rest of you, thank you for the trading."
||aias_||Baeyo looks at her communication device. She scrunches her face and stands up. She just downs the rest of her drink. She glances up at Thomas.
"Hmm...Oh? Ah. I'll consider it, thank you, Thomas. I'm sure for the other interns it might be easier to get their attention than the Trumpets. Kazuo is incredibly tight lipped about seemingly everything."
She grins as she places her drink back on the bar. Maybe inviting him out for a drink would be nice."
||aias_||"Oh, I kid, I kid. Well, for the most part anyway."
She sighs and actually sits up properly. She hops off to grab her drink from the bar and takes it back with her to her seat on the couch. "It looked like the two of them each wanted to take ownership of Theri. They kept dragging her."
She takes another sip.
||aias_||Baeyo appears to perk up at the mention of drunk superiors and Asami.
*I want to see Mr. Nishiji drunk...*
"Neither have I. I mean, I introduced myself, but Ms. Koyama seemed busy with her custody battle against Mr. Akiara for Theri. I hope we'll all find time to chat soon."
||aias_||"I wouldn't worry about it. He's doing what he wants to do. If he was being pressured to act the way he does, then maybe it'd be worth doing something about."
She rolls over from her spot next to Junzo's leg and faces the people near the bar. "I think he acts from the heart. I can't help but respect that."
||aias_||"He thought there was something in the walls and punched a decent chunk out of the general store wall."
||aias_||She tilts her head. "Hm? Oh, I'm sure he'll be fine. He certainly doesn't seem to care much about his injuries or anything else. He just seems like he's simply having fun."
||aias_||[5]! Match!
"--And it looks like you were. Nice."
Baeyo plays with her remaining card.
||aias_||"Thank you, Yuling. Let's hope you're just as lucky."
She grins and holds out her 2 remaining cards in front of her.
||aias_||(1) Match!
||aias_||"Ready?"
||aias_||She's making grabbing motions towards Yuling
||aias_||"Ah. Likewise, Mr. D'Agostino."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> gain one card, <@220287412230815744> lose one card!
||aias_||4!
||aias_||"Looks like it wasn't in the cards for you." (She loves her jokes. They never get old.)
||aias_||(2, 3, 5)
||aias_||"Of course" Smile
She fans out her cards. "You can start."
||aias_||"Mm..When you're done...Please come trade with me... I'm too comfy to get off this couch and search for more cards..."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Thats how carpets kinda work Dante
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Yuling finds a card stuck behind a picture frame!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The carpet is stapled to the ground!
||aias_||<@305913481113239552> Baeyo's looking between the sofa cushions for cards!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||To see the back of the cabinet, Dante slides the expensive drinks to side and finds one card!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Is it unlocked? Where is he looking in there?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Where is he looking?
||aias_||*Oh my.*
||aias_||Baeyo's glancing at Dante from the couch.
*Ooh...Let's see his "lots of fucking game" in person.*
||aias_||Baeyo's also looking for cards! She's gonna try and gentlt pry open the couch cushion with her tree hand looking for stuff
||aias_||Wave
||aias_||She grins sheepishly.
"Heh. I'm flattered, Junzo. Thank you."

She's trying to blow the hair out or her eyes which is a lost cause.

"... Honestly, circumstances prevented me from really holding down a relationship. Things ended very amicably for the both of us in my last one though."

She pauses and chuckles whilst still gazing up at him. "What about you? Have a significant other in your life?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Thomas reaches the sterling no problem!
||aias_||"Nope. Haven't been in a relationship in what... 5 years? If I could even call it that."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Taking all my will power not to say Thomas in earnest 
Bc the closest would be if u broke a picture frame and grabbed the stick
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Dude should pray harder, its like one of those angles where its kinda starting to hurt tbh
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Looking at the floor under the couches, Yuling finds lint! King also finds a sterling, but its just a bit too far if he reaches with his arm.
||aias_||I imagined it like
||aias_||Blink blonk.
"Hm? What's up?"
She rolls off the arm rest and allows herself to fall onto the sofa on her back. She rest her arms behind her head, as it just nearly brushes against his leg. She looks up at him inquisitively.

She shoots Yuling a thumbs up from where she's sitting.
||aias_||"Pfft! Aw, is *someone* getting a little tipsy?" She teases him playfully as she leans further back on the armrest.

She does manage rip her gaze from Junzo, which is a bit hard for her because she finds his behavior amusing.

She tilts her head towards Yuling. "...He's not wrong though. If you'd want to do some card investigation, I'd be more than happy to assist."
||aias_||Baeyo once again hops off her chair and goes to sit on the arm rest of the couch Junzo is lounging in.

"Hm. Well, fair enough. That said I'd prefer to secure some points *sooner* rather than *later*. I'd hate to find out what those placement punishments are firsthand."
||aias_||"Come now, Thomas I'll be quick about it. What if I don't see you for a while? We only have so much time to trade for pairs after all." She fans out her cards again. "I intend to make the most of it."


After a couple seconds her determined expression lightens up and she tilts her head inquisitively. "...Wait, work? Have you not completed your task yet?"
||aias_||She takes another sippi of her drink.
"I see. Not to worry though. She have two more willing participants willing to trade *right* here."

She smirks and points to Thomas and Junzo. "...Not that anyone could refuse, even if they wanted to."
||aias_||She spins herself on her silly little bar stool till she's facing Thomas. "It wasn't in the cards for us this time. Heh. Just waiting to figure out whether we can trade again."
She hums to herself as she plays with her cards.
||aias_||She sighs as she looks at her hand in disappointment.
"No dice. Hmph. Can I have another go? I believe we can draw from someone twice a day, correct?"

`Baeyo has 3 cards again!`
||aias_||"Ah, unfortunate. Aspen would you permit me to draw from you as well?" She's eyeing his hand very acutely.
||aias_||"By all means." She holds her cards out in front of her.
`(3, 5, 1)`
||aias_||"Fair enough, I only get so much enjoyment about speculating about the staff here anyway. I'm here to win." She slides off her stool and goes to sit beside Aspen. "Wanna give it a go while they're at it?" She grins and fans her cards out.
||aias_||Baeyo nods and smiles at Thomas's question. "Mhm. Good morning, Thomas." 
"And somewhat of a tangent but, you know how casinos block out the windows so the players lose track of time?" 

Baeyo closes her eyes and takes another small sip from her glass.

"...I assume the Trumpets may be enacting something similar. Of course, we *do* have access to the windows so perhaps it's not an apt analogy."
||aias_||Baeyo's gonna take a look at her comm device. It's a new day!

She's going to look to Junzo across the room.
"Oh right, I got suspended from participating in the game as part of my punishment. It should have worn of just now."

She's rummaging in her pockets for her initial hand.
||aias_||Guess who's not playing old maid, Baeyo, that's who
||aias_||Whelp
||aias_||Goddamnit
||maamthatsafederaloffense||it sound rude
||maamthatsafederaloffense||HELP
||maamthatsafederaloffense||No
||aias_||<@&1213006530828566598> Is there, perchance, a window in this room? <:devious:1215529624247861319>
||aias_||Baeyo's going to do that as well because her admins about to go to bed too
||aias_||"Capitalism, probably."
Baeyo takes another sip.
||aias_||Baeyo's gonna chill, thank Thomas and sippi on her drink, she's having a great time. //She's npc'ing for a bit while I grab dinner o7
||aias_||"Pfft. With the way they treated us following the gate stuff you'd think I did, hehe." She reaches out her hand and pulls back her poorly graded apology assignment, whilst trading it with Junzo's drink. Instructor Kazuo was *not* liking her essay.
||aias_||It's like 3 pages of the most sincere heartfelt apology interspersed with comments like "This part could use a bit of work" or "plea to emotion not quite all there." its allll marked up
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``Junzo would be able to see in red ink multiple corrections, format suggestions, lots of marginallia comments, questions, concerns. Like wow, all this thing is missing is a final grade!``
||aias_||"It was more of an apology for the whole incident. I guess Mr. Nishiji didn't think my in person apologies to you were sufficient, so he asked that I forward it to you so you'd understand that I was sincere."
She pulls out a heavily folded sheet of paper from her back pocket and pinches it between her fingers. "Boss gave me an annotated copy. Wanna see?" She smiles and waves it around in front of her.
||aias_||She makes a small waving gesture with her hand. "No, no, it's perfectly fine. Though, I am still quite curious what happened to you." She sighs and slides onto one of the bar stools. "...Like I was saying however, there really wasn't much to it. I had my punishment extended till tomorrow. Part of it was an essay of an apology that I needed to write and send to both you and Mr. Nishiji".

She pauses and glances towards Junzo. "Junzo, have you had the opportunity to check your computer at all?"
||aias_||Baeyo nods at Aspen. Her default settings in this place are formal unless told otherwise. She looks over to Thomas and cuts in right after Aspen asks for his drink. 
"--May I have something similar?" She chuckles and grins. "I'm feeling a little fruity tonight."
||aias_||Wave
"Ah, Mr. Desjardins, Its nice to see you again." She tilts her head at the unfamiliar face beside him. She walks forward and extends her hand to Thomas. "Hello, I don't believe we've met formally. My name is Baeyo Lafitte. You're free to just call me Baeyo, however."
||yaoiprincess||She follows!
||elainatime||Sweet. Rodneys? Xavier leaves, holding the door open behind him.
||yaoiprincess||Of course, Id love to see your skill in person. Asami stands up and stretches her legs.
||elainatime||Xavier nods at Thomas. Thanks for the drinks, man. That margarita was *nasty*. In a good way. Xavier offers a fist bump.
You guys wanna go now? To Asami and Aspen. 
<@195352295783923714>
||elainatime||Oh, yeah. Id be down to play for you guys. If you still want to hear it. Xavier seems looser. He stands up, offering his glass back to Thomas. Is there anything I can do? To help, like, clean up? <@298976980307542016>
||yaoiprincess||Asami is peaking over Aspens shoulder just to stare at Xavier. Theres instruments in one of the stores I believe, you should play music in there.
||yaoiprincess||Asami smiles at Thomas as he tells his story and glances over at Xavier. Dont worry about my superior, I promise youll be safe around him.
||yaoiprincess||Its easier when you start young,  If I didnt practice ballet as a child I dont think I wouldve made it this far Asami trails off and fiddles with her empty glass. Still, its very fortunate of you to become a break out star that early, is there anything you cant acomplish? Asami sounds very deadpan but shes being genuine-
||elainatime||Oh, you can find it on this thing? Can you, like, show me? He offers his device to Aspen.
||elainatime||Xavier CHUGS his drink. What? Oh, the task? I dont, really, like, know how to find it.
||elainatime||No? Xavier laughs. The gigs hardly pay. I get more money from tips. He pauses. It depends on where Im playing, though. There are some places, where, like, you cant tip. Concert halls. Those places, they usually pay a lot better. He takes a little sip from his drink. But its a lot more fun to play at, like, bars and restaurants. And clubs.
||elainatime||Thats cool. Do you make a lot of money? Off like, tips and stuff? Xavier accepts the drink.
||elainatime||Oh, yeah, dont worry. I play a lot of gigs at bars. Xavier sits down facing Thomas, putting his elbows on his knees. So, um, how long have you been a bartender?
||elainatime||Oh. Yeah, I could see that. Xavier finishes his drink. Can I have, like, another?
||elainatime||I dunno, I feel like maybe I would be, like, *more* scared. Like maybe he would be, like unpredictable or something. I mean, didnt he, like, do some really fucked up stuff to Junzo?
||yaoiprincess||Have you ever been to Europe ah wait youve been acting since childhood? I never met anyone that dedicated to the art form She leans back in her chair. How long did it take before you reached stardom? Her interest meter is on overdrive-
||yaoiprincess||Have you done any big movies? Not that Im doubting your success- I just dont go to the theaters often. Asami plays with her hair. I would finish medical school while youre at your high point.
||yaoiprincess||You should go back when you get the chance. Asami pokes his shoulder and frowns. Graduating early means you have a gift, a full education would do wonders for you.
||yaoiprincess||You have a nursing degree? Asami leans closer with curiosity.
||yaoiprincess||Asami blinks and scratches her arm. Isnt drinking with your boss considered proper?
||elainatime||You had *a drink* with *Citrus*? Xavier is pale.
||yaoiprincess||Unfortunately I havent, Ive been planning to but its difficult to track them down. I was lucky that Thomas already knew you. She huffs. I suppose it makes sense for my placement with finances but wouldnt Dante be on this team as well?
||yaoiprincess||Well see. Maybe well have a team meeting and kill two birds with one stone. Shes tapping the empty glass with her finger. I wish to see what we all have in common to be on the same team.
||yaoiprincess||Citrus. She hums.
||elainatime||Wait, wait, whos your superior again?
||yaoiprincess||As long as we do our work and follow the rules well be in the clear. Asami pats Aspens back. You should invite him out sometime.
||yaoiprincess||Yes, he was very kind. Asami reaches to finish off her drink. A bit straightfoward though.
||elainatime||Harmless! Thats good! Xavier is so relieved.
||yaoiprincess||Ah I dont. I shouldve asked Superior Citrus before he left Asami scratches her cheek. It seems harmless nonetheless.
||elainatime||Thats awesome. Um. Do you guys know, what the, like, punishment is? For the person who gets in last place? Im just wondering
||yaoiprincess||We both made a pair! Asami smileeees. We all should be tied.
||yaoiprincess||Thank goodness, I hope we get more.
||elainatime||Oh, did you guys win? Xavier tries to look at their cards.
||yaoiprincess||Asami cheers and makes a pair!! Big day for them.
||yaoiprincess||My brain is empty rn
||yaoiprincess||OKAY SWAG
||maamthatsafederaloffense||U could only pull one, its the likelihood not the cards verbatim
||elainatime||i think yeah just one
||yaoiprincess||`[3]`
||yaoiprincess||HFJCHGHFHG
||yaoiprincess||Ill test my luck. She goes for his deck
||yaoiprincess||Asamis two cards she hums and concentrates
||yaoiprincess||((WERE LEARNING I FEEL A LIL SMARTER))
||yaoiprincess||Asami has 3 cards 1,1,5
||yaoiprincess||((OH THATS MY DRAWING NUMBER WAIT WAIT
||yaoiprincess||`[2]`
||yaoiprincess||((Scratching my head as we speak Im also gaslighting myself))
||yaoiprincess||((OKAY TY))
||yaoiprincess||((Sure!! Bear with me because this is my first time))
||yaoiprincess||Asami pulls out her cards and grins. Would you like to try with me while were here?
||yaoiprincess||Did you acquire any pairs? It seems like weve all been dragging our feet when it comes to the game. Asami sighs. but I have been getting my work done.
||yaoiprincess||Asami stretches and shakes her arms. Besides that, how have you been Xavier and Aspen? Anything of interest?
||yaoiprincess||Asami wishes she could drink right now. Thank you. Thank you
||yaoiprincess||Im so confused shes pulling her hair now. Pregnancy means happiness now?
||elainatime||Yeah, I dont - I dont think hes actually pregnant.
||yaoiprincess||What does this mean!? Who is love and friendship and why did they do that to Dante!?
||yaoiprincess||Wh Whos the father? Asami is holding her head. Migraine. Migraine!!!!!!
||yaoiprincess||## Pardon?
||yaoiprincess||Asami swings her legs and hums. Shall we trade cards while were here?
||yaoiprincess||Dante. Asami is trying to make her drink last as long as possible right now. Doesnt he already have a daughter?
||elainatime||Isnt, that, like, what we were talking about? Xavier blinks.
||elainatime||Um, you could just do, like, Are you pregnant,
||yaoiprincess||15? Thats obscene! Asami puts her head in her hands. Pure gluttony.
||yaoiprincess||I can do it if needed.
||elainatime||Um. Maybe you should do it.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks so terrified. What number iPhone is the universe on?
||elainatime||Oh- Xavier puts his device away. Um. I dont, know.
||yaoiprincess||I am not Asami scratches her head and mumbles for a minute before speaking up. I only used a flip phone so Im not familiar with anything newer. Smartphones have AI assistants now interesting
||yaoiprincess||That is true, its like going along with the belief that Santa still exists. She nods slowly. Though some people in this establishment wouldnt be able to handle it Whos siri? She looks around.
||elainatime||Youre welcome. Um. Xavier is fiddling with his device. It seems like he doesnt really know how to use it. Um, one second. He steps away from them and talks quietly into the device. Hey siri? Call Dante?
||yaoiprincess||Her communications device goes off. Asami checks it and sort of raises a brow before putting it back in her pocket.
||yaoiprincess||Thats illogical. Magic doesnt exist. Asami takes another siiiiip. Ah dont tell Valmont I said that.
||yaoiprincess||I dont see the problem with that, texting isnt for casual conversations. Asami crosses her arms. Conversations should be in person.
||elainatime||Um. Oh, she wasnt joking. I can ask him.
||elainatime||Xavier laughs, unsure if Asami is joking or not.
||yaoiprincess||What does that mean? Asami tilts her head. Is there wet texting?
||elainatime||Xavier sees Aspen chucking at him. His face flushes a little bit. 
Um, to ask him if hes pregnant? I, like, really dont think he is
||elainatime||Xavier bites the lime and then goes Aooouuu.hhhh sour
||yaoiprincess||Asami is taking tiny sips. Whos sending the message?
||yaoiprincess||Oh thank you!! Asami is very excited to drink tequila sunrise- even if its a virgin variant. She clears her throat. Apologies, I meant thank you.
||elainatime||THANKYOU FOR THE MARG Thank you! Xavier TAKES A FAT SWIG
||yaoiprincess||You think? Asami raises a brow. So its a possibility.
||elainatime||What? Oh, um, Dante isnt pregnant.
I think.
||yaoiprincess||I can explain for you all, if youd like.
||elainatime||Um Xavier is Sweating. Is he gonna have to explain how babies are made right now????
||yaoiprincess||Im sure Dante can acquire paternity leave Asami hums.
||elainatime||You, like. He gets quiet. Some men, can like, get pregnant, though.
||elainatime||**
||yaoiprincess||Asami points at herself. I am proof that its possible.
||yaoiprincess||## Dante is with child!? Asami is staring at Aspen with fear.
||elainatime||Yeah, thats- Thats actually, like, what I told him too. taking notes 
||elainatime||Oh! Well, thats like. I could see like, for Dante, I could totally see him saying that, as like, a compliment. Like, he means it in a good way.
||yaoiprincess||Oh goodness Asami seems very troubled by their stories.
||elainatime||very casual
||elainatime||Yeah, it seems like, he like, just kind of, does that. Xavier clears his throat. Did you, like, how did you, like, respond to, like, that?
||yaoiprincess||Ah. Hes already making his way to the sun.
||yaoiprincess||I find Dante to be like Icarus- I fear he might fly too close to the sun. Asami closes her eyes to think.
||yaoiprincess||Nothing specific, juice should be fine. Shes peeking over at Aspen.
||elainatime||No yeah, Hes really, Um. Xavier seems to go somewhere else in his brain. really *forward*.
||elainatime||Xavier sits down in the empty spot next to Aspen. Um. Hows that margarita coming, thomas?
||yaoiprincess||Asami stares at Xavier for a very long time before cracking another smile. I understand. I understand. She pats his shoulder- she doesnt understand a single thing. Crashed? Like did he crash into the room?
||elainatime||He wasnt, like, in the bed with me.
||elainatime||Um- He was there, just on the floor.
||elainatime||He wasnt there.
||elainatime||I um crashed in his bed last night.
||elainatime||I mean.
||elainatime|| No its um, alright? We just, I just, like, Ive only like, known him for a day. So its hard to say that we, are like, best friends because we really just met each other. 
-But we did have a sleepover last night.
||yaoiprincess||Asami shakes his hand and tilts her head. You seem unsure, I hope everything is alright with you two.
||elainatime||Asami? Nice to meet you! He approaches her to shake her hand. Um, Yeah, Dante and I are, like, friends. Hes, um, really nice? to me? Xavier scratches his arm and looks off into space.
||elainatime|| Xavier hesitates for a second before throwing thomas a wonky grin. What the hell! Marg me!
||yaoiprincess||Asami Koyama, I believe we havent properly met either. She glances at Xavier. I do remember you, youre Dantes best friend and teammate yes?
||elainatime||Xavier glances at Aspen, who is smiling at Asami. For a second, he presses his lips together. Then he relaxes his face. Sorry, what did you say your name was? To Asami.
||yaoiprincess||Asami smiles back. We havent, its nice to finally meet one of my teammates. Thomas said lovely things about you.
||elainatime||Yeah! Im Xavier! Hello! You must be, um, Thomas! Xavier comes up to him to shake hands, then decides its probably not sanitary to do that, and so just stands in front of the mini bar.
||yaoiprincess||Asami waves and sits near Aspen. Greetings.
||elainatime||Yeah we can,. do that. You can definitely, hear a song, from me, if you want, to-
||elainatime||Yeah, I, maybe, hes, like, coming, ? Xavier needs that drink.
||elainatime||He takes the device and looks at it more closely.
||elainatime||Oh, yeah, it just, like, smelled like, like, lavender, and I was like, I wanted to make sure it wasnt, like, me. Not that smelling like lavender is a bad thing I just thought, like, I dont have anything that would make me smell like lavender! And so I thought it, like, probably wouldnt be from me. Xavier is looking down at the device. Um.
||elainatime||Um. Xavier finally looks at the message. Oh, yeah, I dont, yeah, that probably means, like. Like um, that probably- Im sorry, is that? Lavender?
||elainatime||Xavier gets a whiff of whatever product Aspen uses in his hair. He freezes. Rebooting
||elainatime||Xavier is going to use his guitar rizz.
||elainatime||Did you want to? Like, I dont know, if you wanted? we could like? Go to Rodneys and I could like? Play something for you?
||elainatime||Xavier puts his cards away too. 
Um.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Record this in ur pc channels too Ty Ty
||elainatime||WINNER!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Xavier guess and plucks a matching card from Aspens hand! 

Xavier has 1 card left, and 1 pair!
Aspen has 4 cards left.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||Roll a 3d5
||elainatime||yes?

Xavier has 3 cards left. 

Do you trade again?
<@310530338294202368> <@741816012923600977>
||elainatime||3
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Roll a d5
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Roll a 4d5 in your private channel
||elainatime||Xavier !
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@310530338294202368> <@741816012923600977> whos going first
||elainatime||((i dont know if i understand how trading works tbh))
||elainatime||Its kind of. Complicated. Its actually, like, my guitar? Its in Rodneys. I think they put it there by mistake. But, we can like, go there, if you want. Xavier comes closer to trade cards with aspen.
||elainatime||Um! If you wanted, I could, like, play something for you, on, the, guitar? Xavier is standing there. He is clutching a card. Oh, lets go! I found one too. Xavier turns to Aspen. Should we, like, trade?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@741816012923600977> and <@310530338294202368> you each find one card!

Its going to be a lot harder finding cards from here on out(be like really descriptive!)
||elainatime||You do your own stunts? Is that, like, hard? You caught Xaviers attention with that.
When I produce, its usually more new wave, electronic stuff. Xavier becomes significantly more animated, gesturing with his hands. Theres, like, a lot of classical latin influence, but also like, hyperpop, and psychedelic rock? And Ive been more into, like EDM lately.
||elainatime||Under the couches, in between the couch cushions
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@310530338294202368> qnd <@741816012923600977> get juicer where
||elainatime||Xavier looks like he wants to offer something more.
||elainatime||Oh? An actor? Thats like, super cool. Do you have, is there some, like,  method that you use? I know theres like, different techniques, and stuff. Xavier adjusts his right pant leg. Im. Um. Im a musician! Um. Guitar. But I also. I also produce music.
||elainatime||So are you, like. Um. Do you have, like, a job? Outside of, like, um? Working? Here?
||elainatime||Um! Um! Sure! Backup might be nice, Xavier is sweating trying to have a conversation with this guy. But also, as he says it, he kinda finds himself wishing that he hadnt invited someone to interrupt their one-on-one time.
||elainatime||Oh! Thats awesome. Do you think hed like, make one for me? I could really use a drink right now! Xavier tries to chuckle! It sounds more like a cough.
||elainatime||I dont think Ive met Thomas. Is he also, like, an employee?
||elainatime||Um. No. I dont think so? Xavier is running his hand through the cracks in the couch. Did you say that we could, like, have a drink?
||elainatime||Yeah- Ill definitely, like, Ill be sure to like, get some, like, rest. Xavier bobs his head. Then he suddenly turns and starts looking under the couches and around the room for cards. <@&1213006530828566598>
||elainatime||No-Oh! Yeah, No, I just like, Im pretty like, tired, so thats, maybe thats, probably like what youre picking up on there. Xavier clears his throat. Um, did you want to like? Look for cards?
||elainatime||Um! N- Yes! Im fine! Um. Why do you, like, ask?
||elainatime||! Aspen looking Xavier in the eyes is like a punch to the gut. Its like. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Xaviers eyes are darting around Aspens face. Um. Its like- Um. An arcade? But theres also - Pizza. And a lot of, Kids like to have their, birthday party there? And theres like, Um. A mouse? And his name is Chuck E. cheese. So hes like? the mascot? 
And they do like, they have a stage and the animals perform. Well, the animals have like, people inside them. And theyre not like, real animals, theyre like, costumes.
||elainatime||Xavier remembers that aspen is in the room with him. Um- Did you ever, like, have anything like that? At your, um, school?
||elainatime||When I was a kid, at school, we would do like, Pi day. And we wouldnt have any classes, we would just all gather in the gym as a school and there would be like, a competition? And whoever could name the most digits of Pi got to go to chuck e. cheese. Except, there was also, like, a pie baking contest? Like the actual food, Pie, not the number, pi. And the teachers would like, judge, and then whoever had the best tasting pie would also get to go to chuck e. cheese. Xavier scratches his neck.
||elainatime||Oh, dude, *Pi?* Thats like, cheating!
||elainatime||Oh, duh, right, I forgot. Xavier laughs at himself. Yeah, Im not gonna get this. Just tell me
||elainatime||. Is it 4?
||elainatime||Thats further?
||elainatime||Is it 30?
||elainatime||Oh. So, is it, like, 3? Oh thats definitely it thats gotta be it.
||elainatime||Yeah- er. Can you give me, like, give me a hint?
||elainatime||Is it 8? Oh thats definitely it. Xavier is sure.
||elainatime||Xavier is wiping his hands on his pants.
||elainatime||It was 8. Xavier stands there. Now you think of one.
||elainatime||Xavier closes his eyes and thinks really hard about the number 8. Do you give up yet?
||elainatime||Xaviers eyes SHOOT OPEN! Um. Its! Um. Its! Itsnotanegativenumber. Xavier is now thinking of regular 8.
||elainatime||Are you getting it?
||elainatime||Xavier closes his eyes. In his head there is a big -8. he is rotating it around in his brain.
||elainatime|| That would be crazy. If you were a real psychic then you would know what number Im thinking of. Xavier is thinking of -8.
||elainatime||-! Thank you! Maybe its just the poor lighting in the room, but Xaviers cheeks seem a bit rosier than usual. You did, like, just meet me though. 

He rubs his neck, and then follows Aspens gaze around the rowdy room. Do you think there might be some, like, in here?
||elainatime||Um! Xavier looks away suddenly. Did you know? If we were like, I dunno? If we were supposed to get like, cards? Or something? Or if we were supposed to, like, find them?
||elainatime||Xavier shakes his hand. His gaze seems kind of stuck on Aspens face. Aspen? Can I just say, you like, you look cool as fuck. Like that jumpsuit, is like, so fire.
||elainatime||((can i ask what aspen is wearing))
||elainatime||Oh! Oh, okay. Cool. Xavier takes a step closer. Im Xavier, by the way.
||elainatime||Oh! Xavier stops looking around. Hi! Are you? Sorry, did you have this room? reserved?
||elainatime||Xavier comes in! Hes looking under the couches and around the floor.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``````
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The rotary phone  in the room is ringing
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``Ring Ring Ring``
||yaoiprincess||Asami doesnt smile back nor does she laugh during his story. She does prop herself up to get a better look at Thomas and cracks a more genuine grin when they lock eyes. `Isnt he fascinating?`

Youre correct, I should sleep it off before I get into an accident. Thank you for sharing your story.

Slowly, she slides out of her seat to stand up and make her exit.

Hopefully we can talk more when Im sober, have a good night ~
||yaoiprincess||12..
||yaoiprincess||Good to know, next time hes upset well make him drinks ~ Asami is trying to play it cool right now but the signs are there she cannot handle her liquor. Youre an incredibly talented bartender, what inspired you to to do the bartender job?
||yaoiprincess||Lucky day Asami grabs Citruss drink and finishes it with a happy sigh. I cant thank you enough for bartendin- what? Asami stares at Soseki until he disappears from her sight. What does that mean? What did he mean by that?
||.wozwald.||"Well - Paper is strong against rock, ***NEVER FORGEEEEEEEET!!!!!***"

<a:CH_Peace:715585204244185098>
||yaoiprincess||No, I have no desire and even if I did Im quite dainty. Id be folded like paper. Asami stretches and watches Soseki leave.
||yaoiprincess||The reassurance meant the world to Asami- well, it only felt that way because the alcohol was finally starting to hit her. Either way she was smiling ear to ear and barely flinched when Citrus put pressure on her shoulder to stand. 

The last time she was this happy, her ballet master had complimented her form during practice.

Of course, Im looking forward to meet again.Asami waves.
||.wozwald.||". . . You think maybe one day, you could do that to another person."

Choosing to respond to Asami in a nonchalant manner, even if she said that no way she'd ever do such a thing ; apparently learning to have casual conversation is choosing to divulge into yakuza traditions...
   [  ] `Would it ever be casual?`
Not in the case it was procvided in, not trying to provoke either - Saying no more on that instance, Soseki rose up watching Citrus prepare to take his leave, all the more opting to stumble out rather openly : No shame in being drunk.

   . . . . . . Waving off Thomas, no longer interested in the drink, the Masked man rose , beginning to shuffle off. Time here grew old , and thus interest was quickly directed elsewhere, towards the bumbling host.

"I wonder how a drunk host acts when keeping up appearances. . ."

Mumbling to himself , he soon shifted outward, preparing to leave the room.

"Ciao ladies and gents!" 
||bellboy||*Citrus leans against the countertop. He looks at Asami with pampered lips curled to reflect what would look to be a smile.* " *I'm* not scared of you. " *He assured Asami. His small hand lazily made it's way to grab hold of her shoulder.* " You have nothing to worry about regarding that. " *Extra reassurance. He wanted to make exactly how nonthreatening she was clear to her and everyone else who watched and chimed in without his permission.*

*Pressure is put on Asami's shoulder as he uses her as support to hop off his barstool.* " I'll be taking my leave for now. Would hate to be the first out of us leaders to be apologizing ~ " *He hums.*

" I'll see you all later ? " *A cruel question to ask, really. He knew they were going nowhere.*

*He laughed though it was hard to tell if it was an evil laugh or not..... probably because he was drunk and wobbling out. wobbling ? Stumbling.... he's stumbling....(4)*
||yaoiprincess||I wouldnt describe myself as terrifying, though I understand why my joke wouldnt land very well. Asami stares down at her hands and wiggles around her pinkie finger with a frown. The sarcasm flew over her head, giving her great concern that she comes off as scary to other people. I could never do that to another person, though I do agree that eye and eye is only just for situations like that.

She really wants another drink.

Apologies for getting carried away, Im still learning how to have casual conversation. Is there anything youd like to talk about? 

> <@242165436731359232>
||bellboy||((I am at actual work rn....
||bellboy||*Terrifying ? Of all the things __this__ was what was terrifying ? If that was all it took to scare them Citrus might as well be the hat man. He rolled his eyes in boredom.* " If you want to talk about losing fingers and spiders and all that strange stuff, Stevie and Rhea are probably the only ones who are going to listen." *He assumed that's what assami and maybe even Natsume were into, right ? Weird goth things ? That's what they call "just girly things" isn't it ? Whatever it was, Citrus wasn't a part of it nor was he going to give it his time and attention.*

*He tapped his fingers again, not used to such slow service.* " As for meeting the rest of your teammates, I have yet to meet them. If they wish to meet me they will call and vise versa. I am your trumpet, not your friend. "

<@508392044599705601> <@298976980307542016>
||.wozwald.||As Thomas began working on the drink - Soseki chose to engage in listening to Asami in the brief second that she began talking about self-defence...  
Only as it began to delve into the subject of using Yakuza punishment methods - A similar grace and lifestyle, not one he's foreign too. Citrus proposed the question , taking note of the slight offense that became easily apparent.

   "Yubitsume ritual - Man you're *terrifying.*"

His voice coarsed into a sarcastic tinge, but keeping it all smiles - The masked man was playing coy with his words.

"I know the question wasn't aimed at me , but an eye for an eye is all but fair in this sort of world. "

There was his own interjection, soon turning away with light laughter.
||yaoiprincess||Shes back very exhausted and disheveled. The second she sits down she grabs her drink and finishes it in one go before slamming it back down. My apologies for my absence, anyways I wanted to ask if youve met my other teammates. 

Interesting enough her voice drops just a bit to sound rougher than usual.
||yaoiprincess||Im glad you think so- Asami swings her legs and places the drink back onto the table. She checks her comms device and groans. Ill return in a moment, excuse me.

> <@298976980307542016>
||bellboy||*Citrus takes the fruity drink and siiiiips on it. sweet. He liked it that way. He sipped and sipped as he listened to asami ramble. He doesn't pay attention to what she talks about. that was boring. What he was paying attention to was how she talked about it (16).* ***Interesting.***

" **hilarious.** " *He says without laughing. He didn't thank Thomas but he acknowledges that the beverage did taste good. So good that he found that he ran out. He sets his glass aside, naturally expecting a refill. There's no manners with this guy.*

<@298976980307542016>
||yaoiprincess||Its still self-defense, Im still caught off guard by the coffee pot weapon. She shakes her head and tries to laugh but it comes out as a light exhale. Her thoughts sway back and forth between the coffee pot and Citrus somehow preventing the coffee pot from hitting him. Asami thought it was impressive, maybe even *cool.* If she was there, the coffee pot wouldve landed on her face.

An answer is requested from her but it throws Asami off enough to stare at Citrus wide eyed.

What would I have done? 

`She already knows the answer.`

Asami relaxes and turns her gaze to the side of the room.

TW | Finger Amputation Are you familiar with the Yubitsume ritual? ||Its been quite popular with the yakuza for centuries. Whenever an underling causes you offense, the only way for them to properly atone is to cut off a portion of their pinkie. She holds her pinkie up and slowly curls it.||

||The perpetrator cuts off the tip and wraps it in cloth to gift it to their superior. If more offenses are committed then they cut off the next joint of their finger. I suppose if I was in your shoes, I would do it the old fashioned way and demand an eye for an eye- or would it be finger?|| Asami stares at Citrus silently for a minute before cracking a smile. `Feel free to roll perception.`

Im only being humorous. I dont know what Id do in your shoes, I havent been attacked before- long isolation maybe? Ive heard solidarity confinement does well for some people. Asami holds her drink delicately between her fingers and quietly takes a sip. Thank you, Mr. Ray. This is very delicious.
||bellboy||<@298976980307542016>
||bellboy||" Of course I'm not injured. " *He sounded mildly offended by the thought. Him ? Injured ? Never ! He tapped his fingers on the countertop, waiting for his drink.* " I struck him before he could strike me, is that not how self defense works ? " *He seemed genuinely confused by their confusion. He wasn't about to let himself be harmed if he himself could do something to prevent such a thing from happening !*

" What would you have done, Koyama ? "
||yaoiprincess||Asami blinks once then twice then her entire face scrunches up with complete disgust. Not because of Citrus but because Junzo. Sexism is unavoidable and a product of society, trespassing is a given because of their circumstances and natural curiosity but to cause violence

`. . .`

## ???: 1%

Asami fixes her expression and crosses her legs. Theres too much on her mind to allow her to focus on anything, she only gazes down Citruss prosthetic with curiosity. `Perception: -3`

Thats understandable, one must defend themselves in the face of danger. Still, are you injured at all? I cant fathom why a situation would escalate that far.
||.wozwald.||Quaint as it was , the other didn't take really much interest in what people were choosing to drink, looking over at the bar with average amounts of attention. Albeit the Masked Man soon rose to his feet having heard the story, approaching the group with a small raise of the hand , and nothing further.

   "Mister. Thomas, feel free to surprise me with a drink, I ain't really much of a drinker though - So give me something you'd feel sports a non-drinker   "

Felt like joining in, even if on the side-lines, making use of the one who had a facility and knowledge to properly use it... Would be a waste otherwise, and indulging in new things, orientation stated this was all about team-work even if the ones at the bar weren't his team exactly... But the new tidbits of information was the bonus that allowed him to keep going casually. <:hi_BernPeaceful:1006476176958685334>
||bellboy||*Citrus's own posture fades as his chin falls onto the palm of his hand.* " I'll take a tequila sunrise. " *An oddly happy drink for the moody young man. perception roll.*

" Junzo Ishikawa received the punishment he was given because he was to proud to sit in the box of shame and apologize for his access breach, sexist behavior, and physical and verbal resistence towards staff. He was punctured due to the fact that he had attempted to harm me with the breakroom coffee pot multiple times. " *He explained immediately. The annoyance in his face grew as he continued recalling the story.*

" ... " *That was it right ?*

*Wait.* " Oh ! I uh- " *He lifted the pants on his left leg to show off his prosthetic. It seems to be that...a normal prosthetic that kinda resembled the look of an old test dummy.* " Please understand that I'll defend myself by any means necessary. If I am attacked, I will attack back. " 

<@195352295783923714> <@298976980307542016> anyone in the room can roll as well.
||.wozwald.||<:AMUSEMENT:1189342929010032814> . . . He'll remain sat where he is for now, listening in - Gesturing for Etienne to come and join him so they can at least look busy. So that's the 'superior' here to try and coax something out of him likely... Though base it on assumption more than anything of an indicated feeling.

   "Hmm. . .~"

So they can call the ones that run this show for talks like this , well : Not entirely surprising with the phone in the room, but he ponders the messaging service.
||yaoiprincess||Asami shoots Thomas a concerned glance and tilts her head. Is it alright if we have you to make drinks? I really wish to try that drink you recommended earlier. She clears her throat again and sighs, she can only be mad at herself for not drinking water.
||bananices||Etienne goes quiet and watchs it all proceed in front of them, taking a mix of mental and physical notes as they learn more about each of them.
||yaoiprincess||My intention was to leisure with you, now that youre my superior its important we meet formally before assignments are given out. I do admit that I have curiosities about Mr. Ishikawas situation but the topic can be avoided altogether and youre free to ask me questions as well. Asami locks eyes with Citrus and then looks down at herself. Ive been told that Im quite stiff and Ive been meaning to fix that, I apologize if it gave off the wrong impression.
||bellboy||*Casual ? As far as Citrus knew, he was still at work and will be for who knows how long. He looks at Thomas's hand and then back to Thomas. He's not shaking that.* " I'm assuming you've called me here to question me about the noisy one in the stands ? I doubt you're here for leisure with me..." *His dark eyes look up and make defiant contact with Thomas's and then Asami's.* " I can see it in your muscles. Stiffness isn't seen in relaxing moment now is it ? Neither of you are impressing me with your false posture now get on with it. What do you want ?"

<@298976980307542016>
||yaoiprincess||Asami straightens up her posture and fixes stray hairs. Im sorry to hear, I hope the situation didnt cause you any grief. Shes gesturing to Thomas to come over.
||bellboy||*Citrus walks in appearing more irritated than usual. He takes a seat near Asami.* " My time was wasted by someone else. " *That's one way to say " I'm sorry for being late."*
||bananices||They straighten in response. "Oh, I'm an arsons investigator."
||bananices||:O They find this very exciting indeed, glancing to follow her gesture and raising their brows.
||yaoiprincess||Im a professional ballerina- prima ballerina for the Royal Ballet Company to be specific. Asami gestures to her shoes.
||bananices||Etienne looks back and forth, waiting for someone else to go first on instinct.
||yaoiprincess||Of course, I havent participated in a company drink session in a long time so Im incredibly excited. Asami is straight faced.
||yaoiprincess||Asami doesnt drink very often so avoiding would be a good call if she gets carried away. She thinks and nods to Thomas. Youre right, I should refrain until he arrives though its been some time. She nervously looks at the clock.
||yaoiprincess||That sounds delicious, Ill gladly have it. Asami blinks and slumps in her chair. My superior isnt here yet, Im starting to worry for his safety.
||.wozwald.||"Very well then~!" <a:Aa_Clap:750703180362547221> Hands clapped together periodically , he soon followed behind  Etienne, then quickly deviated towards the couches.

"It's happening here, right? Keeping watch isn't all too bad , but who'd expect you to have a superior in this place , surely it can't be anyone *that* important. . . Aha , nope probably not!" Playing his words as vein as he could be, soon sitting down on the couches with a slump. Leaning back into them, though with a subtle shifting of hands, wondered if any couch treasures were left here by previous generations....

Someone might've lost a TV remote or something.

> <@&1213006530828566598> **IS THERE ANYTHING DOWN THE BACK OR SIDES OF THE COUCH?**
||bananices||"Ah, I think it'd be a good idea to stay. And interesting, as you put it." They emphasize his word in acknowledgement. Etienne nods toward Soseki before moving to close some of the distance between the pairs.
||yaoiprincess||Asami peeks over. Excellent. Do you know any recipes for fruity drinks?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||I know it says minibar,,, but like anything u can think of, or anything thomas could possibly need to make is here
||.wozwald.||Oh - ? There's been more people : So sudden as well , choosing to keep his comments about Etienne making floor plans.. Generally a good idea even if a brief rough-sketch. As there had been two more who with their own ideas, as grand as it is... *Exaggerated.* The masked man simply waved them over with interest of his own.

  "Your superior - I'd be interested to meet them , what say you, Etienne, if not we can head off elsewhere, you still must be itching to explore around, right?"

Head dropped back with a looping smile, waiting for the others opinion on whether they should stay or not. 

> <@357641088208732181>
||yaoiprincess||Asami chimes in. However, I want you both to act appropriately, do not upset him please.
||yaoiprincess||Itll be alright as long as the drinks are good, I believe you have enough poise to not offend my superior. Asami stretches and tries fixing her posture so its as straight as possible.
||yaoiprincess||Asami turns to Thomas for that one.
||yaoiprincess||That is true, Im intrigued to figure out what happened to Mr. Ishikawa.
||bananices||They seem confused. "Oh, I'm just curious to know the procedures regarding it."
||yaoiprincess||Asami turns to Etienne blankly. My superior is arriving for drinks so choose your actions carefully.
||bananices||Etienne peers over their shoulder at the commotion. "If you manage to get into the bar..."
||yaoiprincess||Asami pulls out her communicator and hums. My invitation has been accepted. She smiles at Thomas. Lucky us.
||yaoiprincess||Nothing yet. She tilts her head and copies Thomas expression. Did your boss turn you down?
||yaoiprincess||Asami clears her throat and shoves her device in her pocket. That was nerve wracking, Ive never messaged my boss through phone before.
||yaoiprincess||Both of us should contact our superiors so it doesnt appear we play favorites. Asami pulls out her own device and slowly types out her message. This is very embarrassing for her judging how many times she deletes and rewrites her message.
||yaoiprincess||I think its a lovely idea, it gives them the freedom to decline or accept to come to our location. Besides, I dont know where my superior is Asami frowns and rubs his her cheek, for some reason shes very embarrassed about that.

Itll be good for us to have a good conversation before receiving our assignments.
||yaoiprincess||Not if we avoid being detected and watch our intake. Asami doesnt smile but she gives a reassuring nod. We can do it the old fashioned way and set up a friendly meeting with our superiors, its often said that drinking with coworkers is good for relations.
||yaoiprincess||Do you have a pin in your possession? Asami combs her fingers through her hair she lost her bobby pin a while aho.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is here! She is looking around inquisitively.
||bananices||'Trying not to worry' in any capacity is advice Etienne knows they simply cannot follow, but they mention it not.

"You are someone who can go with the flow then," they suggest. It seems like an understatement. How is their peer not concerned, at least outwardly? It generates interest of his own. 

"I'm just making some diagrams of our rooms so I can better estimate the scope of our quarters, and checking for any evidence of wire-tapping. I had my picture taken upon exiting my room, so it'd be good to know what channels are being utilized. Where are the ins and where are the outs, in all senses... audio, visual." They nod, feeling as if they've covered it decently. 

Etienne tries to remember their mother's old advice about how to make better conversation with people, and how to use small dishonesties to be polite. "Oh, yes, you did distract me." ...It seems they have failed to remember the right steps. 

"But it is alright. It is good to meet people, and you are very interesting to the eye." It's said with an almost-academic tone, a scientific observation of sorts.
||.wozwald.||(( AAA gotcha !!
||bananices||//HIII SRY just saw this!! if I ever take too long pls ping my ass
||.wozwald.||Looking around the room - There's the minibar that caught his eye : But more importantly , side-stepping across the room as his head fell back onto the other. Etienne, huh? Interesting name , not something he's heard before which is only catching the fascination a little more... 
Oh but there's a little bit of information circulating - Just from his eye, after all bearing witness to their manner of profession... 

"Try not to worry about my words- I think we're in it for the long run , there's no indication of being able to leave, ta - They've created accommodation purely for us ; they're confidence in this game working out, and if that's the case. . . 

    '       !  "

Springing both hands upwards in a jazz-hand motion, ticking head side to side. They've been asked some peculiar questions, yet opted to sling it back towards the one who was asking.

"You , my friend ? You seemed to have been caught up investigating - Hidden components, maybe? Did I distract you from it?"
||.wozwald.||<:gabagree:1179549273948438559>
||bananices||Their eyes follow him and his motions in curious regard. The investigator first moves to take their notepad from one of the many pockets on their coat, scrawling the romaji for his name down at once. 

"To ponder the notion of 'over time' is interesting. Have you resigned yourself to staying here long-term? What do you make of this so far?" They note his rather pleasant demeanor, at least from what they've been told about demeanors most find pleasant. But they're caught up in their questions already! "Ah, my apologies. I'm Etienne Tetuanui," they bow their head slightly.

... And it's right back to it! "It's strange indeed. What would you say is the strangest thing you've observed so far?" The hand holding the notepad taps its pointer to its thumb around the little book. Maybe there's going to be a test later.
||.wozwald.||"Strange, no?"

Finger danced along his chin, pushing up his mask in quick readjustment: It's nice to see investigative types and not all compliance to a new environment. Offering a brief sideye to further understand how this new acquaintance acted.. Certainly one of the more quieter ones, which makes sense if you look back at everything thus far.. `Feral people exist here.` 

    `. . . Feral people.`

          `. . . Cavemen.`

Referring mostly to Dante in spirit, with their disposition to be as fight instead of flight as possible compared to the only one with a normal thought to question everything: Junzo... Yeah , most are compliant in this situation. Sheep in a herd that flock to the voice of a shepherd ; undoubtedly the eyes of many would lump Soseki in the category too , yet all you'll have to ask is whether it's foolishness or a fool playing clueless.
   [ <:mari_smile:802068977027121163> ]
Opting to give a small curl, into a smile on his face, a slither of agreement fell into his voice.

"People aren't as inquisitive about our new surrounding as I thought they'd be - But it makes for a rather interesting start-up for future endeavours, and how everyone will move over time. . . Maybe I'm also just tired of the endlessness today too . . . Ah , but it's rude of me to not introduce myself-"

    A curt bow presented, arm gestured to the side in a welcoming fancy , looking up at the other.

"Even without having asked - Nor cared, Natsume Soseki : Knowing names will make everything better in the long run, ta~? What's yours?"
||bananices||They straighten, turning over their shoulder to catch their new company from blurry peripheral, before dropping their hands from the current furniture-victim and properly turning to face him.

He is instantly scanning him up and down, stoic expression in tow. 

"Mm, I think I've had enough of things happening for one day. Just trying to better understand our environment."
||.wozwald.||Originally with a plan of returning to his room - The whole lobby debacle made such a thing leave ones' mind and left them walking without much purpose until they stumbled into the party-room.. Rowdy alright  
Who doesn't like it though - Not really his style, especially when it contrasts the current lifeline of empty... All but one.

The red-head casually following behind them for a few seconds with an observant eye, before piping up a sudden... 

   "Waiting for something to happen ~ ?"
||bananices||Etienne is here, carrying out their usual absurd routine for a new room. They begin to rearrange decor and run their hands along and under just about any notable surface or structure in the room. At least there are no plants in here to dig through.
||snombi||She's following behind him..
||snombi||She's about to step over to go and try to help Junzo out, but then he said that he was stabbed, and she immediately stops, as though it had happened to her. And she's suddenly afraid for her life. And now she's wondering if it'll happen to her. And now Mirai's going to stab her too, and Junzo's going to hurt her because she saw him like that, `and now she's going to-`

"..Yes, pl..please.."
||snombi||Oh, wow! Also, what! When Junzo stumbled out, she's immediately snapped out of her little happy place and she turned her head to see him. She's internally freaking out because how on Earth did he get like that? And also, where did he even come from? 

"Aaa.a...aaaah.. He...hello.. Do, ummam...mam.. You need.. h..help..?" She got up slowly this time, not wanting to have another headache.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@272831332059447297> and <@196879022909554689> 
Suddenly, from the back of the wall, <@555990109355507712> stumbles out like he's pushed out of the room. Looking different. There's a click behind him, so whereever he came from...it's just gone.
||snombi||<:zymochawow:765133493386084352>
||snombi||Soraya is still in this room...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||It's going to happen regardless, 
it's just so you know
||maamthatsafederaloffense||are they still in the room?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||happens
||maamthatsafederaloffense||something
||maamthatsafederaloffense||making sure before
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@272831332059447297> <@196879022909554689> are you two still in here?
||snombi||"Oh, um..! Okay.. Th.. Thank you.. for.. ta..talking with me, Akagi.." She dipped her head respectfully to them, matching their bow too. "Enjoy your, um.. food..! And I.. I won't.. I hope.." 

"Uhh.. don't.. be.. be.. aa...ahh.. a stranger e..either.." <:hamnyoron:915076765314076692>
||snombi||She was doing a great job? Oh, gosh.. She felt a little giddy, which honestly surprised her. She very rarely felt that way, and whenever she did, she was worried. Her lips quiver with a smile and she even let out a quiet laugh, which should be noted since Mirai was one of the few people that have actually heard her do that.

"..Th..thank youu.." She felt like she could just. Melt into a Soraya shaped puddle.
||snombi||She was already broken once, she doubted that Mirai could make it happen a second time. She's relieved that she had people like him and Yuling on her team, being as kind as they were to her. Perhaps she was lucky in that regard. If she was paired with more of the louder personalities, she definitely would've been in a worse state than she was before. She definitely would've passed out or worse. 

When Mirai lifted up a hand, she instinctively winced, but then she realized no harm was coming to her. He was just asking like a high five, like Dante had before. She needed to remember that. She raised a hand of her own and returned the high five with a small smile.

"Thank you.. so much.." Sheesh, she wasn't used to all of those compliments. And Mirai sounded like they had their work cut out for them, that's for sure. He had a lot of experience, to say the least. "Oh, that's true.. I never thought of it that way.." Silly Soraya.
||snombi||Oh lord, she felt like that was a shameless plug for her business. Hey, free advertising! They did have quite a few properties available, but she had no idea if that'll change when they leave. Even if they weren't planning on buying a house (can't blame him whatsoever for that), she appreciated the thought. "Th.. Thank you.." She's going to blow up.

"I.. I like working.. with numbers and.. all that.. I.. I have m..my.. associate's in.. b..business management, and I.. I really liked.. taa.. taking all the mmmmnn.. math classes.." She briefly looked down at her lap and she took some breaths. She was actually talking with someone.. She's talking and doing things, she's.. normal, she's.. 

..She'd ruin it eventually. 

"I honestly thought we'd be.. um, penalized or.. or something if.. if we didn't.. guess correctly.." She muttered. 

And don't worry, Mirai! Compared to Soraya, their softness was probably ten times more strong than her, uh.. stick-like physique. She was fragile, that's for sure. "I.. I hope I.. I can learn.. a lot while I'm working.. Maybe even.. aah.. apply it.. to my.. other job.."
||snombi||Yeah, selling houses..! She nodded and even smiled a little bit, relieved and also thankful that someone cared enough to ask questions about what she did for a living.. Almost like there was a meaning behind her existence and ability to work.. That's insane.

"Mmhmm..! I.. also, um.. schedule.. app.. appointments for.. p.. potential clients, I, um.. I make.. ch..charts.. and even advertisements for the.. the company sometimes.." She did a whole lot of stuff, it looked like.

At least Mirai didn't think she could bring the team down. If she ever did, she'd probably never want to work ever again. Or even breathe again. Or live. She could never live again if she was deadweight.. Can't spell deadweight without "dead"! Haha.. Yeah.. That's totally what she deserved if she wasn't good enough.

"You, you.. um.. You really.. m..mean that, Akagi?" She was still so surprised.. Did she deserve that help? "Thh.. thaaan.. thank you.. so.. mmm..much.. for.. for both those th..things.." <:Pleading:1090791702178050150>
||snombi||Soraya held both of her hands in her lap as she was listening to Mirai speak. And wow, people cared enough to ask her questions? She's still internally reeling from that and she absently curled some hair around her finger. 

"I.. suppose I.. I must've.. wanted to take on a second.." Was she gaslighting herself? She had no idea. "Oh, I.. I'm.. I am.. a secretary for.. for a real estate company.." 

She's never been outside of Japan, so this was all new for her. Maybe it was the jet lag, maybe it was a combination of things.. This was so confusing, but she didn't want to make it worse by thinking more about it. Knowing Soraya, she'd probably spiral..

"I, um.. hope not.. I.. I'm.. not good at.. games.. I.. I, ah.. I don't.. want to drag the.. the ah.. tee.. team down because of my.. incompetence.." She briefly looked away. She knew she was bad at a number of things, but she loved doing paperwork, she loved the smell of manila folders, she felt elated whenever she organized things properly, and just.. she was meant to sit in that office. She wasn't meant to play games and do icebreakers. 

"It's.. not just you, um.. It.. It made me.. really uncomfortable.." :(
||snombi||She's been told her name was pretty twice now.. Maybe it really was.. She reached her other hand up and brushed some hair behind her ear, already getting a little sheepish.  

"Aaha.. Th.. Thank you.. f...ffor thinking so, Akagi.." Maybe today was going to be okay. Bless their heart, honestly. 

"And, um.. it is.. I, ah.. I'm just.. surprised I, um.. was.. even looking for.. more work.. I.. I mean, I'm.. I'm, um.. good where I'm at outside of.. of all this.. And I.. guess I told.. my.. my, um.. family about it too.." They did bring up a good point. She liked her initial job and she got paid enough, so why would she go out of her way to apply to other places? It didn't feel right, but she was too much of a doormat to speak up about it. 

"I.. probably just.. forgot I.. I was.. ee..ehh.. even doing that, knowing m..meh.. me.."
||snombi||She anticipated more to follow after Mirai stepped in, but she was pleasantly surprised that no group was following them inside. Oh my God, this.. this was.. perfect.. When the other sat near her, her blue eyes drifted to get a better look at them and for once, she wasn't overly panicked or overwhelmed when speaking to them. 

"Oh, ah.. Hello, um.. Akagi.. Um, you're on.. the same team.. as I am, right..?" She recognized their name, at the very least. She sat up straight and reached out to offer her own hand to shake theirs. Her hand was a little cold in his, but she hoped it wouldn't be much of an issue. "It's.. nice to.. m..meet you.. I'm.. Soraya Hasegawa.."
||snombi||She's here, and honestly, she's relieved when it's as quiet as it is. She was honestly expecting a crowd or something and when she found none, she went to one of the couches to have a little seat. Honestly, she wanted to get out of her room and walk around some more. She leaned back and she took a long breath. Yeah, this was nice.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||``...``
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh- yes of course, " he shrugged as if it were just another friend, "I'll see you soon Mr. Desjardins. Happy New Year." He picked up the glass... smiling to himself as he watched him go. Watching through it with a sense of satisfaction that can't be placed...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh, these are meeting's are rather- hmmm I know they do," he nods acknowling Aspen's concern. "Dress code is really just enforced during these sort of special occasions- and well. I suppose no one really wants someone walking from their room nude. Gives a sense of, you know we're in it together, I mean, look at me." Kazuo gestures to his office fit, and although a bit more tailored, as one would with a chairman salary, it is not *that* different.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He laugs again in general. 
"I try to be, y'know it's really incondusive to a productive work enviorment if your superirors are someone you can't just rally approach. So really, it's really nothing special, just apart of my duties."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Now is that the tequila or is that just you," he checks his face with the back of his head to see if he's still just a bit flush. "Oh yeah, it's really advanced- they're just double checking it out you know, making sure the operating system is neat and tidy."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He smiles when Aspen compliments him again, Kazuo pulls out the little Triangle out of his pocket again. "So these are the Sterlings, again, sure you can keep these, they get a big heavy after a while. So you can bring up back up to Lynceus, and he'll take care of the exchanging it to your device. I didn't wanna overload you guys, especially on your first day. So...yeah, we'll call you back, taking a break for now."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||FIXED IT READABLE NOW
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He laughs the compliment off. 
"Aw shucks, you're gonna make me blush Mr. Desjardins," he pauses. "Oh, if you do prefer wine, we do keep a good selection. Not here though- hmm...It's real...I bet if you get Lynceus- he's the bellhop- if you do a favor for him and get it done he's bound to give you a discount." He shrugs off handedly, "Sweet kid."

"Ah- but uh, yeah," he does a light facepalm. "Sorry, did you have any questions?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh it's just a tequila sunrise," he chuckles, finding the answer a little amusing, biting off his little garnish. "Just leave your glass here, I may have teams here, but I still don't want to give the sense of preferential treatment."

"But you know, anything to get people accustomed."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo pours him one, and puts it away, being sure to lock it. He mixes it with tender precision, as if he's made this plenty of times before. He hands Aspen a glass and picks up his own so it doesn't make any  noise when it comes off the bar. 

"Yeah, shame huh?" He smirks and clinks his drink with Aspen's.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ah, I like to hear it Mr. Desjardins," he gives a generous point to Aspen and writes one more thing down before tucking it away in his shirt pocket by his own badge. He drums on his lap and stands up. "Well, I can get you a drink, if you're interested," he points his head over to the minibar. "I read your application, not a big one on people, yeah? Totally get the noise, totally. I got to be in a place to hear my thoughts too. I got too many of them." 

He pulls a key and starts fixing himself a small drink. 

Aspen may also roll perception.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"You must not make it to many hotels then Mr. Desjrdins," he chuckles a little bit. "Most guests in hotels tend to hate extra noise, yeah? So we have these rowdy rooms, you know for when people are bit more than what other's can take, if you get it?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"No, no, have a seat mr...." He fixes his glasses to look up at who came in and his lights up. "Mr. Desjardins!" he pronounces the name with ease. "Yes, I'm just taking notes. Did you have any questions?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo is just sitting in here writing...
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``` ```
A lounge sort of party room, it has nice carpet and nicer fixtures. Theres couches for people to sit down by and lots of room for people to disperse and mingle. 
A mini bar exists, but the cabinets are locked.

||starzono||Oh great. The seating area. Fun. Time to go!
||aias_||Baeyo's following Tiff! To the seating area....
||yaoiprincess||Asami follows with a plate of finger foods shes hungry afff
||.wozwald.||"Ahhh ~ A wise choice : For one or for others : Being indebted to another is always a bad situation especially when you know not who you're dealing with."

A sterling propped in between his fingers - Then simply that, he follows suit. <#1193047866260856902>
||sadpastry||"Smoking is not..." Ah, no point in blabbering on as a nurse usually would. Especially with the announcement. "Nevermind! Off we go."
||helminthic||Ope. He nods to Natsume like he was bowing under a stage light. Then forward to the <#1193047866260856902>
||helminthic||Uno shifts his weight.

"I know smoking kills me quicker-- but I don't really care. I'll die anyway.

But I don't want your money."

He looks at his finger nails as if they had any nail polish left on them. Checking out his cuticles... Uno didn't want to make any eye contact either...

"I'll manage on my own."
||.wozwald.||"Of course - Smoking kills you quicker - Do you wish to die quicker then ~ ?"

Nonchalant humming
||helminthic||Uno doesn't respond for a moment.

"No. It actually doesn't."
||.wozwald.||"Who are you again?" 
||.wozwald.||<:sousmug:1006246659640021064> He's so generous he knows - No point in hiding it. 

"However much you need : unless you barely made a shilling , of course that just means you owe me come the future : A basic exchange, I'll hold you to it : Does that help you exist a little longer?"
||helminthic||"I don't... That's just how desperate I am... Imagine how I feel when I'm trying to do my work and--" Uno squints at Natsume. Is this a happy squint or a suspicious squint? The world may never know.

"Spot me? The whole 5 hundred?"
||sadpastry||Her eyes WIDEN. "That is very generous, Natsume! Wow!"
||.wozwald.||"Hm ~ Then I'll spot you the five-hundred : Out of the goodness of my heart."

Clapping his hands together with a light hum. "Later on though ~ Would be a shame to just let it go to waste now." <:smil:837379270879215637>
||helminthic||Uno scratches the back of his head, then checks his shoulders like he's making sure nothing is there. He wipes at them. "Yeah, that i--" and he looks over at Natsume..........

"Extremely. I wish I could chief my room mate's vape that's how desperate I am."
||sadpastry||Callista high fives him with a smile! "Thank you. Huzzah!"
||starzono||GASP.
Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness Mirai. Wow.
||.wozwald.||"I'd wager the less you play the game - The less you find yourself invested in earning ~"

Walking over to Uno - Tapping his shoulder. "How desperate are you to feel smoke in your lungs?"
||sadpastry||"Very! I have never gotten paid before! This is very exciting to me.." Her eyes sparkle...
||helminthic||Uno hugs his envelope like he was clutching his pearls. "I feel like it is embarrassing."
||sadpastry||Callista hugs her envelope.
||helminthic||Uno looks up. "I want to at least *smell* a cigarette."
||helminthic||Uno stares at his envelope. Damn... He can't get what he wants the most.....
||.wozwald.||"No - Not in the slightest. Try again next week ~"

Slinking back into the crowd - Sorry hes more interested in the theatrics of the ongoing potentials of this show.
||helminthic||Natsume.....
||starzono||He just shows it to Mirai. 1119 sterlings baby!!
||.wozwald.||Soseki has his swag envelope 

"Zzzzzzzzz  "
||starzono||Valmont hops on over to Mirai and hes like
Mirai. Mirai I am rich now.
||helminthic||Uno has envelope....
||aias_||Envelope get!
*Cue Zelda item get theme*
||starzono||Man takes a glance at his paycheck and man is just. Stunned. Holy cannoli.
I. Do not think money will be an issue.
||starzono||He watches as Kazuo leaves, wow.


Well, that was surprisingly fun!! I rather enjoyed that!! I think we should do things like that more often.

Hes just going to pop over and grab that envelope of his. Heck yeah <3
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Mirai will get a grater duck. 

"Well this has been fun,"  Kazuo looks at his watch one last time.

"But I do need to set up something for later on, feel free to keep on intermingling, or uhm, actually!" He puts down everyone's envelopes, names listed in nice handwriting. "Pick up your paychecks, But you can also just check your wallet on your comm. IF you want to withdraw your Sterlings, please head to the front desk. I will call for us to readjourn in a moment. And please," he takes a soft, somber breath, "be aware that it will delve into more uncomfortable territory." 

He then departs. 

<@&1012808089424105614> 
> if you would like to grab your enveliope (and be paid) pls ping me in your pc channel so I can give u ur Sterlings. I will also be taking a break for a lil bit, event will continue later on tonight.
||starzono||:D!!!
Clap clap clap!!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Wow! How'd you manage that? Do you want it?"
||starzono||Hes like. No way.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Mirai?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Anyone?, Anyone else?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ooooh that's a cool idea, but that ain't it, sorry."
||elainatime||uhhhh isnt that like a beer cooler for when you want to have a beer in the bathtub? but its a duck too.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"What is your guess?"

||starzono||"Yes!!!!"
He wants to win.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Wow, and that's that for you. Valmont and Mirai's prizes are forfeit to you." He nods. 

"Well hm..." Kazuo checks a watch. 

"Lightning round anyone?"
||starzono||He's disappointed in himself, he couldn't win the sterlings back for Mirai, but, ice crusher...
"If it is any bit of positivity, we can have snow cones still!!"
||aias_||I gotta put Baeyo back in NPC mode real quick so she'll accept her prize, relinquish the ice crusher and sit back with Hinoki if that doesn't cause problems
||starzono||"Aaaahh... I don't eat apples that makes sense actually."
||aias_||"The *core* issue here is that it isn't for opening bottles but rather opening apples. It's an apple corer."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Miss...Baeyo?" Valmont has gotten it wrong...
<@248897197935034378>
||starzono||He has no idea what fucking bottle that thing would open but you know, 60's were weird.
||starzono||`68` oh god he has no fucking clue what this is though

"Oh, thanks mademoiselle Baeyo!! It is appreciated."
<3

"My guesses are between a bottle opener and something for icing a cake and I don't believe either of those are correct so-- The former?"
SHRUGS.
||aias_||but money is like....money......
||aias_||Well....i mean she doesn't have ice....she cant use an ice machine......
||aias_||LMAO
||maamthatsafederaloffense||THIS IS KILING ME IM PICTURING MIRAI SIPPING HIS LEMONADE SIDE EYEING
||aias_||She will turn to Valmont and smile. "Don't fret. If for whatever reason you don't get this, I'll return the ice crusher to you."
||aias_||Oh whoops `41`
||aias_||Baeyo's waiting in anticipation...again with a knowing smile...
She seems antsy for some reason though...

||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I mean- it *is*? *Is* used to defrost freezers."  He nods agreeing with himself. 

"Well at least you can read  pictures through your fun bangs. Now!" he claps. "Baeyo you can take all of Mirai's assets....but you know, I'll make it fair. Who wants to try to steal from Baeyo?"

||aias_||//im just now realizing that the freezer or refrigerator defrosts is in the pic
||starzono||DAMN that was his guess, he just wasn't certain of it.
||aias_||She squints at the thing, glancing up as if to remember a vague memory.
"I believe...it was specifically to defrost freezers no?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yes?"
||aias_||Baeyo raises a hand
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"OOoh... not quite. I do need the specific thing it is defrosting..." 

"Can anyone name what it's for?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Defroster for?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oooooh... Mirai?" <@196879022909554689>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright, Tiffany! What's your guess?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright, so this means if both Mirai and Tiffany both get it wrong, someone can steal Mirai's points. Ready?"

||elainatime||Dude, I thought we were mice.  hes so sad
||sadpastry||Awwww.. She nods approvingly. Meowing fixes everything.
||starzono||"Are these new kitchen appliances or were they used previously?"
He is like 65% certain these were just taken from someone's kitchen.
||helminthic||Uno hesitates.

"Meow" He says.
||aias_||"I'm game to continue. I hope you won't run out of kitchen appliances, Kazuo~"
||helminthic||"You know what nevermind. Sorry."
||helminthic||....
||helminthic||"Dante. You can't just ask someone that. What if I asked you that?"
||sadpastry||This is fun! I shall get the next one!! Pumping her fist!
||starzono||"I am fine with whatever!"
;D
||elainatime||I WANT TO GO AGAIN!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Crazy," he shrugs. 

"Moving on, does this mean we're done playing the game then?" He asks the crowd.
||starzono||Valmont's thinking about how many times he has heard Dante ask that sort of question to someone.
||aias_||*I'm getting the oddest sense of deja vu...*
||starzono||"That sounds fun!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Noted!" He claps his hands together. "Why don't we have those dueling rounds now, We'll do two- then we will do three free for alls, how does that sound?"
||elainatime||Can I try again I feel like I should have gotten that one
||sadpastry||My next guess was a fly swatter, wow. You guys are so smart! She claps!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yep! That's a Safety Grater- you can really lose your knuckles on the other ones." He flexes his gloved fingers. "Do you want it or it's Sterling value?"
||starzono||"Are we just getting someone's old kitchen knick knacks????"
||sadpastry||Oh! Oh, that is smart.
||elainatime||i hardly know her
||aias_||"The sum of its parts."

||sadpastry||Oh. I thought you were asking me, apologies.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Sure, what's your guess?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||it is the DRYEST of delivery by the way
||aias_||Baeyo is looking at the item with a knowing smile. She seems interested, but is waiting for other people to give it a shot.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"You got it wrong, you can't steal."
||helminthic||Uno doesn't cook. He has no idea.
||starzono||Both Xavier *and* Callista were wrong???? Damn if only he knew what that was.
||sadpastry||.Yes, I would love to steal.. Is that.. wrong? The.. The cookies? pleading emoji..
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Who would like to steal? I'll take three guesses?"
||sadpastry||I am not sure that is correct, do not be so sure.. Your guess was very very good!
||elainatime||Xavier seems upset. Fuck! Dude its definitely that. I cant believe I didnt think of that
||sadpastry||She curtsies nervously.
||sadpastry||Oh! Oh.. Uuuuuummmmmm Callista seems very bashful and unsure of herself.

Is this Is this an item that Is it a sort of spatula? Where you.. Okay, so.. say you made you made cookies! The cookies are on the hot pan from the stove. You need to transport the cookies from the hot pan to a cooling rack, so you use that item to slide under the cookies and slip on the cooling rack!

||sadpastry||Id like to give it a go, maybe! Sort of! Potentially! Shes nervous.. <:hiye:1090187318851276842>
||aias_||"I know a guy." ;p
||elainatime||Did you guys all go already?
||elainatime||Wait, can I play?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo doesn't get it, 

"Who hasn't gone yet that wants to play? If not we can have people that have gone, to go again, this time playing for all what you have so in Baeyo's case if Mirai beats Baeyo, Mirai will get Baeyo's Sterling prize."

He is very proud of this game. <@&1012808089424105614>
||starzono||"Oh, oh that was clever!!!"
Clap clap :D
||aias_||"Hmm...well unless you'd allow us into the kitchen to get some bread I'm afraid I'll likely redeem the Sterling amount and in another sense, *get that bread.*" She's grinning...

Glad she could make herself laugh.
||elainatime||Xavier starts laughing really hard.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Would you like the bun warmer or would you like it's Sterling value?"
||sadpastry||She pats his shoulder gently twice. You shall see the truth soon What.
||elainatime||Oh dude, theres a mouse hotel? Thats fucking awesome
||helminthic||"Mouse hotel..." Uno is still pondering.
||elainatime||Xavier sits??? next to dante
||elainatime||Dante dante bo bante!!
||starzono||"I am sorry, mon ami. I hope your day gets easier!"
||sadpastry||xavier
||sadpastry||Ask her about it next time you see her! She will be happy to show it to you, Im sure.
||elainatime||Xavier!!!
||starzono||"Do not worry, Dante! I did not know either."
||sadpastry||GASP. AND HIGH FIVE. She is so joyous.
||aias_||"I was about to say. Our hotel already has a mouse hotel."
||sadpastry||I was JUST ABOUT TO SAY THAT. Callista says this happily.
||helminthic||"Dante, how many mice do you host where someone would need a mouse hotel?"
||sadpastry||Aw, that is so cute! A mouse hotel.
||helminthic||"Mouse hotel?"
||aias_||"Well it's a bun warmer is it not?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright Baeyo, what's that item?"
||aias_||Baeyo finds the inclusion of this item funny`67`
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He motions for Baeyo and Tiff to step right up. 
<@248897197935034378> and <@161652713359147009> d100
"Alright buzz in for you guesses!"
||aias_||Hand up!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright we'll send that to your room. Can I have the next two to raise their hands?"
||starzono||He makes a heart back 
||aias_||clpa clap
||aias_||https://tenor.com/view/sophie-saturday-gif-25518556
||yaoiprincess||Asami claps for Valmont!
||starzono||"I'll take it!!"
He doesn't need Sterlings right now, plus his bestie wants a snow cone so.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Correct! Now did you want it, or did you want it's Sterling Value?"
||starzono||"Yes!!!!! You can!!!"
:D
||starzono||"I have one!"
Not that he ever uses it.
||starzono||"It's an ice crusher. Very helpful for shaved ice!"
Man does not know how to respond to Dante honestly.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oohh,....Valmont, would you like to steal?" <@272423756809371670>
||yaoiprincess||Asami cant even laugh at that one shes praying bro says sike
||aias_||Bae's suppressing a giggle
||starzono||oh my god?
||starzono||blink.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||just a guess miss meat
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"What's your guess?"
||yaoiprincess||See what glass does for you KING
||starzono||Valmont's too damn confused by the fact Dante licked glass APPARENTLY `11`
||maamthatsafederaloffense||chipmunk dante
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Hmmm...we'll see!" 

He calls Dante and Valmont up.
<@272423756809371670> <@220287412230815744> roll d100
||starzono||Valmont just looked over to Dante.
"...Why was there glass in your mouth??"
||helminthic||Uno is not interested in going. Assume he is npcing.... Ping me if u need me...
||aias_||"Oh no, Mr. D'Agostino is onto me whatever will I do~" She moves a hand in front of her face in mock concern, looking quite amused.

"...However I merely wanted to ask if the items we don't choose will be available in Rodney's after we're concluded here."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeees?"
||aias_||"Question first." Baeyo raises her hand but not to play just yet.
||starzono||Hand raise :O
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Awesome, now that we all get it now- who wants to go next?" <@&1012808089424105614>
||yaoiprincess||Asami bows. Big day for girls saving up for cigarettes.
||aias_||clapa clapa :)
||sadpastry||Yay Asami!!!
||starzono||Clap clap clap!!!
||yaoiprincess||Sterlings. Girl has nothing to keep track of like at all.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo does a little clap. "Correct!" He then pauses, "Did you want it or it's Sterling equivalent?"
||yaoiprincess||Her eyes are red and she looks like a mess. I am assuming were looking at a timer.

((We sell these in my store isnt that crazy? They actually suck irl))
||maamthatsafederaloffense||mirai i love youuuu
||yaoiprincess||Mirai shes trying really hard not to laugh like tears in her eyes
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ooooh, good idea but sadly no," 
he turns to Asami.
<@195352295783923714> "Would you like to steal?"
||starzono||damn. He was just like 
He thinks it does look like a safe though.
||yaoiprincess||Can you roll perception on Asamis face
||yaoiprincess||Dont roll perception for Asamis expression her ass is turning her head away you only see hair
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo looks secondhandly embarassed for Mirai like its like face scrunched up, Steve Harvey having a question that's a sexual innuendo embarassed. 

"...Did you want to guess what it *is*?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||can you roll perception on kazuo's face for me
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright, Mirai, what's your guess?"
||yaoiprincess||Asami stands at the table and puts her hands behind her back. `17`
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Alright, so Asami and Mirai, I need you to stand over there," he points to a table, " I need hands behind your back. I'll click the projector, and you need to hit the table first to let you guys guess.  If you get it wrong, the other gets to steal, If you both get it wrong, then I'll let someone from the crowd guess" 
He looks to the general audience. 
"That means, if you want a chacne to win, you should hold your tongue" 

<@195352295783923714> <@196879022909554689> to buzz in, d100 who goes first.

He then displays the first image.
||sadpastry||Callista claps for the both of them!
||yaoiprincess||Yeah they would.
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises her hand
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo makes a shrug, "Let's Make a Deal is a bit closer- "I'll take two at a time, Raise your hand if you want to go first."

<@&1012808089424105614>
||starzono||"Oh!! Like, the Price is Right? Sort of?"
He doesn't remember when that show came out (I googled. 1972)
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"You can stay in your seats you long gone twins," Kazuo chuckles a little. "We got a little slide show- and all you have to do, is just guess an item. And if you get it right, you can ask either for the Sterling value or the actual item itself. Sounds easy enough, right?"
||snombi||Soraya just kinda mumbles a "no, thank you".
||starzono||Valmont on the same wavelength as Mirai...
||starzono||"What kind of game?"
there's so many games being spoken of (two) and now he's confused
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@&1012808089424105614> 
 "With that said, before we move on to more serious buisness," he rests the paychecks on the podium. 

"Who wants to play another game? It'll be quick! Like a small game short even...." mini-game is on the tip of his tongue.
||helminthic||Game..... Uno crosses his legs like the polite boy he is not.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"We did Old Maid this last time, remember?" He sighs remembering such sweet simple times. "We are going to start another game."
||yaoiprincess||Asami nods and puts her hand down, this is the most professional and coherent response shes gotten from Kazuo like ever.
||starzono||"Shifting? To what?"
Probably an obvious question but hey, he's asking it anyways.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"As for payroll scheduling, we are driven to make ammends," he nods, "as our current focus in work is about to shift."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He says rather practiced, "Because we are working with the currency of Sterlings, once festivities are over, it will be paid out in currency of your citizenship, as in the US dollar for example, while abiding the current status of your citizenship or residential area's tax codes. However, because we expect you to complete things to term, we will, well to put it simply, we will not worry about it now. That is to say, please continue to treat Sterlings like cash."
||helminthic||"Good question. And are there any upcoming changes to the payroll schedule?"
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises a hand. What is the tax percentage for our paychecks?
||snombi||This was quite possibly the longest time she's gone without getting paid for her work.. Finally.. She hides her discontent from waiting for that long by squeezing back on Mirai's hand. Yippie..
||sadpastry||<:xaviergasp:1214852666040127489> We get paid?
||helminthic||He says unenthusiastically
||helminthic||"woo hoo!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo walks onto the stage from a side door. 
What a pleasant surprise! 

Kazuo walks to stand at the podium. A soft smile and elevated stance are all clear signs he's excited about today. 

"Thank you all for attending. Today marks a new month, and also our returning to scheduled plans. As you are all aware, certain events have placed several roadblocks into our festivities, fun and most importantly, work. Therefore, today we will first make amends to all of these before we start off on our new slate as a company. "

He taps a large stack of envelopes on the podium. 

"That starts, with your paychecks."

<@&1012808089424105614>
||starzono||"Fine, all things considering! That will likely change before too long, though."
Knowing how these events tend to go, he's assuming it won't go well. But hey, maybe there will be a pleasant surprise!
||yaoiprincess||It has, how are things Valmont? Asami is prepared to hear the best answer ever or something that needs to be unpacked.
||snombi||Of course she will.. Teehee..
||starzono||He is not gonna eat at the moment, but he's chilling next to Asami <3
"Mademoiselle!! It's been too long!!"
Small talk <3
||yaoiprincess||Asamis here in the work uniform she wears everyday, shes eating finger food next to Valmont
||helminthic||Uno is alone probably.
||starzono||Now he is here! In stuffy office gear ew. He hates it so much. He's just. mmgnhnnhg.
He did wave to all his friends though!! Which is everyone except Uno right now. Hi friends <3
||.wozwald.||Soseki will be an npc
||aias_||Bae is gonna NPC beside NPC Hinoki!
Grinning and waves :D
||sadpastry||Waving to everyone!!! Yippee!!
||snombi||She's going to get some lemonade before going to sit by Mirai. Teehee.
||helminthic||Uno is here..... Slightly npcing.... Masked up in his office clothes. They do not match at all.
||sadpastry||Callista steps into the room with Yuumi NPCing behind her. Wearing their work uniforms! <:HEHE:1038291410610298990> She takes a seat towards the front, chilling.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||> As everyone enters the screening room, there is some small cups of lemonade for refreshment as well as some finger food. Easy listening music....ambient
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``` ```
||kyunu||*With a grin, she goes!!*
||kyunu||"Well, nonetheless, I am envious. ~" *She says, not providing much more detail, with the same plastered smile.* "Great work in scaling the wall." 

"Then... shall we move on?" *Hinoki begins to walk back towards <#1208948110752227328> , with the intention of moving through <#1212803669943124008> .*
||kyunu||"You're quite adept at athletics- I'm impressed. ~ " *Hinoki clasps her hands together, before moving to go pick up the step ladder.* "Do you work out, or do parkour?"  *She asks curiously.*
||kyunu||*She steps back!*
||kyunu||*She places her hand on her face, smiling at Tiff.* "I think it might be best for you to come down. ~ Maybe we can come back to it after exploring the mall."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||it just seems li ke a standard window sliding lock, something openable from the inside, like to keep flies and people nicknamed Tiff (not this one in particular) out.
||kyunu||*She walks back in here with a step ladder, only about 2ft-3ft tall.* "Apologies, I couldn't find anything much more useful than this. Perhaps we can use it for something else though... The only other place I can think of checking is the <#1213243441698570240> ."

"If the window is locked, what kind of lock is it? Maybe I can find something we can try to pick it with, unless it's locked on the other side... ~" *She's brainstorming.* 

"I can always keep looking around for something useful. ~"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The projector is pretty standard for the time being. It makes sense for this wall and the wall on the right side to be thicker based on wiring. Pluss when you landed your feet it was a thick?dull? noise, not a thin?hollow one.
||kyunu||"For all we know, this is just a big, fun game! ~" *She knows that's not true.* "I'm sure they wouldn't mind." 

*With that, she walks out.*
||kyunu||"Should we try breaking it? ~ It's not like we know any of the rules of living here, anyways, so *maybe* we won't get in too much trouble." *She laughs, calling over to her.* "If you don't mind, I can go take another look at that closet and see if there's anything useful we can use in it."
||kyunu||"How's it looking up there?~" *She calls out to Tiff.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Youd have to open the window, she could fit in, but window is locked, or just stuck.
||kyunu||*Hinoki claps excitedly at her skills!* "Wow, amazing! ~"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Tiff hardcore parkours hee way to the window sill and lands real nice. Whats she up to?
||kyunu||*Hinoki steps away from Tiff...*
||kyunu||"Well, it was filled with supplies- but I doubt a stool would be enough to climb up... I could see if the shelves are removable or if there's-" *She pauses, watching with intrigue.* 

"Oh, sure thing. ~ Be careful."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Maybe jumping on a table and parkouring up?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The podium isnt moveable, but just because its like solid wood and has metal in it
||maamthatsafederaloffense||If you get a running start and jump, youre gonna hit your hand just below the sill
||kyunu||*Hinoki watches Tiff curiously, also taking a glance at the vent.*

Hm do you think we can move the podium over to the vent? Or perhaps use the chairs ~ 

*She walks over to the podium- is there anything on or around it? Does it look attached the ground?* <@305913481113239552>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Emptyvent is open but too high up, and the actual projector seems to be behind a window.  (Baking breadslow as hell)
||aias_||Walka
||aias_||wow how did Baeyo get here crazy
||aias_||`. . .`
||sadpastry||After some time, also out!
||sadpastry||``
||sadpastry||NVM HERE
||sadpastry||thru..
||snombi||And she does! After Yuumi..
||pulsatilla||"Follow." He walks off.
||snombi||As a resident living doormat, how could she refuse? Maybe this was how she made friends.. Or something. She doesn't question it, she just nods.

"Oh, um.. okay.." That was easy.
||pulsatilla||...Keeps busy... keeps busy... Ah. 

"I see." He punches the palm of his hand, a lightbulb going off in his head. "I need to keep busy." Yes... he had an idea of what he wanted to do, but... he takes his phone out- typing.

"There's something I've been meaning to do..." He looks up at her, stare. . .

"You will assist me."
||snombi||Oh, God, not *her*. Eeehh.. She was so uninteresting.. 

"..N..nn. Nothing.. important." She says rather matter-of-factly. "I.. ah. Just.. wander about. Th.. there's not.. much that.. keeps me.. busy.." She's honestly surprised that some people have that much.
||pulsatilla||"There's nothing to be concerned over." He says almost instantly after her.

... Perhaps he should move this conversation to be about herself, rather than him. "What're you doing here?"
||snombi||"..Be.. Because.. umnn.. I, um.. I.. can?" Okay, she's never really asserted herself before. That felt weird. "..Th..that was, um.. rude.. Sorry.. I.. I.. wa.. was just, um.. concerned.." She admits.
||pulsatilla||"No. Everything is perfectly *fine.* Why even ask?" Something is very clearly not fine and pestering him, yet he tries hard to keep it to himself... even if he's presenting a vibe unpleasant.
||snombi||OH NO SHE SAID SOMETHING WRONG SHE'S GOING TO DIE

"Hhh..Hi.." Her voice is so shaky. She scoots a little closer, trying to test the waters of actually talking to people a bit more. "Ummm.. mmmnhh.. is.. something.. th.. the.. ma.. mah.. matter..?" clearly 

It's okay, she expects this from anyone she talks to.. It makes sense that anyone around her would be in a terrible mood, regardless if they were feeling bad before seeing her.. Totally..
||pulsatilla||He SNAPS his head to her direction, eyes squinted. "What." Oooo... I'm sorry Soraya.... he's in a bad mood... (even though he always sounds like he's in one...).
||snombi||GRAAAAHHH!!! As she's sitting down in one of the seats, she spots Yuumi pacing about, wearing a dress. To be honest, she wasn't going to judge; anyone could wear a dress if they wanted to! Although, she does look a little.. concerned, but she isn't sure how to even start. Uh. Maybe.. ask him? *Dumbass.*

"..A..Akiara..?" She calls, already feeling herself trembling. Come on, now, stop that. You got this, girl. Maybe. Perchance.
||pulsatilla||Into here! Yuumi isn't quite sure what drove him to come here, but here's here so who cares!?! He's so mad... fuming... pacing back and forth- he doesn't even notice Soraya despite her being in the room first. GrRRAAAAGHHHHH!!!!!
||snombi||It's been a hot minute since she's been here. Now that she thought about it, it's been.. hmm. Over a week? She thinks? Since they've started? It felt like a lot longer than that for some reason. In any case, she's mainly here for how quiet it was, not wanting to stay in her room again. Guh.
||bellboy||*Stevie's finger tips lightly grazed her lips to "hide" her obvious smile. She looks around the room to feign innocence. Did the popular girl strike a nerve ? Oopsie daisies ~ She does a few cartwheels before exiting the room.*
||bellboy||*Akiko was right ! She didn't care and still didn't even after that long winded explanation.* " Mmmhmmm that's what weapons were made for ! To make it eeeasier...~ ! " *Stevie continued to keep her body moving and it wasn't to use up energy. In fact it was quite the opposite ! She was keeping active in order to stay awake through this absolute snore fest !*

" So what you're saying....is that this fighting style...is a combination of other fighting styles.....that sounds ground breaking. " *Sarcasm is laced into her otherwise kind and cheery voice. That tone of hers somehow grew completely flat yet still fluty. It seemed she can't help having pep in her step no matter the emotion she feels or expresses.*
||bellboy||*Stevie begins to stretch and bend, ocassionally using her arms to lift her own body weight but nothing crazy. (12)*  " Oh yeah ? " *All in all stevie seemed to be bored of this fighting style Akiko has started yammering about ,but her smile remained. She just looked kind of...plastic.* " Then in that case you are in no need for a weapon...you can just make one out of anything, yeah ? " 

*She can't say much of her opinions on this new martial art. She knows nothing of it...but she can't help but think that Akiko is just describing glorified senseless fighting. Boring.*
||bellboy||*She returns to her former state. Relaxed...welcoming !* " Oh wow ! I can't say I've heard of that sport before ! " *She hums sweetly as she sways back and forth.* " Weapons are fun I suppose. Kinda like...a golf club to golf ! But that is just equipment and equipment isn't typically used to gain the upper hand is it......" *She shrugs.* " I still have a preference for my own strength, but that's just me ! " 

*She takes a few steps closer and stops them with a spin !* " But if you need leverage I understand ! Not everyone is strong like me ~ " *She teases.*
||bellboy||11
||bellboy||*Ah ! Stevie is unsure if that was a sad cry or a happy cry ! She'll....take it as a happy one !* " Have a fun time ! " *She chirps at her !*

*Now back to Akiko. Her hands place themselves on her hips.* " Now what a load of nonsense ! You do not need a weapon to be strong ! " *She gets into a fighting position. She appears to be rather sturdy in her stance but it's hard to tell what her strength looks like under her thick sweater and "girly get up"* " Simply be strong ! A weapon is nothing more than assistance ! "
||frooztiez||``[OVERCOME EMOTION: 0]`` She begins to fully sob, and slowly leaves the room.
||bellboy||*Stevie sighs dreamily at the thought of a baseball bat.* " Can't say I do, I'm sorry " *She sighs again.* " I wish I could have one though...a batting cage would be so totally fun ! " *Sorry theri, stevie totally thinks you're making your merry way out to have fun with your good friend dante !*
||frooztiez||``[OVERCOME EMOTION: 1]`` She starts to tear up immediately.
||frooztiez||"u..............................uumm.u.ummmmmm." Now she's looking at Akiko, as if she has to ask for permission to leave, but the words just don't come out of her mouth. She wants the other to be okay!!! She feels bad!!!!
||bellboy||*Stevie tucks away her handkerchief.* " It'll be okay ! Go show Dante your sword ! I think its wonderful that you've made friends with a team member ! " *She's so genuinely happy for theri. What an improvement !*

*As for Akiko. Her boots click on the ground when she turns to face her.* " I do not have another, apologies. "
||frooztiez||Theri's been in a little bit of a mental rush, with the revolving door of trumpets (the whole 2 of them), but she's snapped back into the reality of potentially murdering Akiko because she stubbed her toe. ...................nnow she feels worseeee.... gouugh and her face is being dabbed at.... She flinches heavily whenever the cloth gets close to her face... it's more likely to make her cry now than before.....

"....nnooo......theeyr'e not....... bullying me. bbutttt theyy cc....coullllllllld....... thouhg............ uummmmmmmmmm....." ....oooh she's making them wait.... gghghg hurts her head.... and she just told dante about her cool new sword she got for free... "hhghg...hh,... uum..." ..buuut leaving Akiko would be rude.... now she's at an impass.... what does she do.... her head hurts smore...
||bellboy||*Stevie takes a handkerchief out of her breast pocket from beneath her sweater. Its super cute...pink and lacey...she totally made it herself it has her initials embroidered on it ! It's dabbed gently on her face in hopes of drying her running tears.* " Awe, don't cry ! Who's jumping you, huh ? Are you being bullied ? " 

*Her attention is split between theri and the living dead ! Akiko ! She turns her head to look her up and down.* " You look sane, I guess ? " *She totally took " check my head " a totally different way.*

<@373652537024315392> <@330260289843101696>
||frooztiez||she starts choking on her own saliva                noT PREPARED FOR THIS "ghohgh.ygjgh.gh.mgggggggggggggggg,.,.//////////////////"

She *now* begins to tremble. she was on such a good streak of being around people... now her head hurts.... "......nooo........ iiiif ii don't......... goo they.....         jump.....mmmmme................"
||bellboy||" Awe..." *She brings her into a hug she probably doesn't want !* " I'm just so happy you're making friends ! You *want* to hang out with others and you're out of your room ! That's wonderful ! " *Just girly things. two girls and a sword.*
||frooztiez||"........??g/hgh/h?????" Alongside having no idea how to invite people to someone elses room, she also has no idea how to respond to a compliment. At least, one said in person. her fortnite skills always get complimented...

``[OVERCOME EMOTION: 16]`` Instead of immediately bursting into thankful tears, she just kind of nods. "ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooookkkayyyy..................." ...stevie's aura does hurt her eyes though she looks down a little
||bellboy||*She looks at Akiko and shakes her head.* " That's not a dead person ! Silly ! " *And back to Theri.* " Oh ! " *Theri AND her DEVICE ???* " I am so super proud of you Theri " *She's beaming ! She makes shut in gamers blind !*
||frooztiez||She also flips her device towards Akiko, with DANTE's call to action... "uummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm............                      uuuuuuuh........"

she doesn't know how to invite people places....
> <@330260289843101696>
||frooztiez||"mg.jg'.,'.,.!!!!!!!!!!!" Her initial 'holy FUCK person' shock turns into '.....ggggggggift...........' shock, as she holds the sword in her hands like its a GUN.

She points at Akiko! "......i      think                    they're                     okay                                                          now........................           uuuummmm....................." Now she looks at Akiko. are they okay what did she do
||bellboy||*She teleports here and hands Theri the sword.* " Hey heeey ~ ! Where's that person you might've killed ? " *She seems rather chipper ! It feels nice to help someone !*
||frooztiez||fuck you kazou i rolled a nat 20 for NOTHING but this pickle
||frooztiez||CLOSESE it.....
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Yah
||frooztiez||he really did that huh
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo leaves, sealing the jar. 
||frooztiez||``[OVERCOME EMOTION: 9]`` With shards of vibrating, hazel glass as her eyes, she slowly reaches into the pickle jar.... and takes one... it may break her emotionally.

"....................????????????????????" Now she's just standing there with a pickle.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He gestures to her.
||frooztiez||"..............................................................yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy........................" she vibrates with uncertainty.... does she want one...???
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo looks down and just takes it back. Thanks. Did youwant one?
||frooztiez||She holds it like a bomb. And akin to unsheathing a sword...

``SCHWING``

... it is OPENED. ``[NATURAL 20]``
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Can you open this for me? He hands her the jar of pickles.
||frooztiez||".........................................hhhhhhhhhggggggg............." Her entire response. She's waiting for Stevie to stab her from behind.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Suddenly Kazuo.

Yello~ he is carrying a jar of pickles. Stevie has a task for you miss. He is looking at THERI dead in the eyes.
||frooztiez||">.............................................................*hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhmngmmmmmm*................................" She almost jumps out of her skin when Akiko touches her head, entirely freezing up in a state of panicked shock. Like a bolt of electricity, she immediately straightens out to perfect posture, towering over Akiko with her... 2 extra inches of height.

From the little bit that can be seen, it is very much so a recent wound, aggravated by the slamming of her foot and Akiko's entire existence. hghh..hgh,g.. hahttttee how close....... she takes a reactionary 3 steps backwards, before taking 2 steps forwards because she assumes the 3 steps backwards was rude *but* she doesn't wanna get that close, lest Akiko jumpscares her and kills her immediately.

......She's still mostly unsure if she's worthy of having a bandage at the moment, with her hands slowly moving upwards to take it off again, but then Akiko brings up the whole 'bleeding out' thing.... and also Akiko's head isn't bleeding as well... so as much as she hates the idea of having hurt someone she will just sadly move her hands back down.

"...........oookkkkkkkkayy.............................. imm......... sorrrrrry.................." She still looks like she's about to start crying. That never goes away.
||frooztiez||As soon as she's stopped Theri freezes entirely. No breathing, no trembling... like when you startle a small dog by touching it and now it's unsure if it should keep shivering in excitement or swap that to confused excitement, but replace excitement with DREAD.

Is she not supposed to give her bandages>??? A bit of her own blood drips off of her forehead onto the floor, but she doesn't seem to process it. No give??? why??? why no give???? hurt theri brain.... hurt theri brain lots.... make theri want cry but theri not cry.... caveman theri...

She's still most definitely freaking out, but she's trying to pay attention a little. She *really* has no idea if anything she's doing is right now (I.E: breathing), so she just... continues her trembling.

"......buuggt....... yyour. rrrrr yyouerr....." Now her hands finally figured out what to do, pointing at Akiko's forehead. Isn't this the least she could do? Theri doesn't really need it, and it probably has all of the healing properties that the doctors have... theri doesn't go to the doctor's often

"wwwwwwwwwwgh.h.............hg.....................gh/???????" She's so confused, but she's at least stopped picking at her open wound. Now she's just... trying not to cry. Genuine glass woman, will break if left out in the sun for more than 20 minutes. 

"...................................................................*hiiiiicicchci*........................" ...now she's trying to catch her breath.
||frooztiez||One of the funnier things is that Akiko is one of the rare few people that Theri is actually *taller* than. Fully expecting to have to look up at the other, she's momentarily surprised to have someone at her own eye level. Short queens...

If Theri's a china-shop, she's one built on sand. Her entire figure continues to *tremble*, hands rapidly moving from being slightly outstretched towards Akiko, to inwards near her chest quietly trying to feel her own heartbeat (~107 BPM), to quickly scratching at her forearms. ghghgfuomgm.hh.m..... is what's on her mind!

Her eyes are as wide as the moon, trembling little glass bowls of hazel just *waiting* to burst.

"........................................gmgm..................................ff...g.h................hhh............" She's *really* trying to form a response, but whenever she does she's cruelly reminded that it's *her* fault, only doubling the headache and stomach troubles. She'd love to not worry, but sadly one of the things Theri is the best at is worrying!

...and overthinking. This person just got a head injury.... and Theri has a head injury..... theri has a head bandage.....

Theri begins to take off the bandage on her head. "ogiho..................................iiiiiiiiiimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm sooooooooryrhy............ hghhere.e.eeeeeee...." She is in so much pain there was glass in her skull, but she's still trying to somehow remove it and give it to Akiko! What the fuck!
||frooztiez||hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhGAHGGGGGGGGGGGGG they're NOT DEAD hghth. thhhatsss--------- that's good that's better than them being dead bgugtlh........ Theri lets out a huge sigh, letting one singular tear drip out of her eyes... she wins they didn't die.... she's gonna reward herself with not talking to anyone for at least a week after this...

She'll take a few genuine steps forwards, shifting from the 'where do i hide the body' mindset to the 'maybe i should actually help this person. maybe. if they don't bite and aren't intimidating and are basically a small dog', and a cautious approach is launched!

...which is almost immediately stopped by her own dawning feelings of guilt. Stubbed toe -> Loud noise -> person slams head... which is Theri's fault... and she doesn't really know how to... remedy this... and now her stomach is starting to hurt because of it... ouhgh....

"...............ummu..u.uuuuuuhh...? juummmmmmmm..?????" Her mind is totally blanking *whhhaggt does she dooo???* Who patched up her head.??? It wasssssss........ their name started with a Y....... umm....... oohgh her stomach hurts h.... uum... Theri begins to gently tremble... she's thinking too hard, and now her head is starting to hurt even more, but if she thinks of that she starts comparing it to this new person's head trauma and really her's isn't as bad as slamming your head and immediately having to deal with it and-

"..........gu,.........." She holds both of her hands out in front of her, trying to shield herself from the thoughts. "iiiiiiimmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm sooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrry.h.,hjhhiiic,,..................,....." She is so genuine and if she was braver she would actually check if Akiko is okay.
||frooztiez||Theri's injury is much more mild (save for the head bandage), but she totally fucking destroyed her big toe against one of the steel(?) chairs, crumpling almost immediately into herself and clutching her foot. "mgmghgaahhgmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmggggggudfucmdfmfmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm......................."

``[OVERCOME EMOTION: 9]`` Hot tears prick at the corners of her eyes... but she's strong... she won't start belligerently sobbing just yet!!! That's for later in the interaction. 

Slowly, she stands up, and-

oh my god someone is dead behind that screen hgoio oooooohhh my goood "g.................wwhhhhhhhhhhhhufaat....????? ooooooooohhhgg myy....... ggggggoo*ioood.......dsmfddf*.." she KILLED someone oh my goodness..... does she go closer they'RE DEAD goho......

she takes like 2 eensy steps forwards. not the bravest...
||frooztiez||The THIMBLE is here....

Sporting a bandage on the top of her head, Theri is here! She'd initially wanted to go back into the rowdy room (she still wants to steal the cushions for her own room), but a sudden intense fear of the exact same thing happening to her again has caused her to travel elsewhere in search of those cushions.... and here she is....

ghghh.hmhg...... person........ "............................................................................................gkgh--" She fucking *slams* her foot into one of the seats before she's able to just slip away....... dratz....
||elainatime||screening room
||sadpastry||..It is my duty. No need for thanks. Off they go!!
||sadpastry||Callista just smiles warmly, wrapping one of her arms around Akikos torso. Her other hand grabs her arm carefully and wraps it around her own shoulders. Classic half hug situation.

Let us be off!
||sadpastry||No injury is good news.

*Uuumm*.. Yes, if you think you can walk? Do you need help? She opens her arms, ready to support however she can.
||sadpastry||Sorry, sorry.. A stream of apologies briefly come from her. She sits beside Akiko with a brisk hum, awaiting any possible aid she could provide.

You see Um. I just wish to.. help. For our partnership *and* friendship. You are not wounded, right? My medkit would not provide much help otherwise.
||sadpastry||Callistas hands clench along her apron. No. We both know you are beyond fatigue. I understand though, you do not have to disclose details to me. I just.. wish to help you.

She smiles weakly, Perhaps we could sit down? Take a break at least.
||sadpastry||``

Miss Akiko! She calls out, frantically rushing up to her. Are you well? I am a nurse, did you forget? How can I help you? She seems.. frazzled.
||sadpastry||NAT 20 BATS MY EYELASHES

Callista was a wanderer, so she just kinda walked in. Seeing Akiko, she opens her mouth to say something, but she decides to wait and see if she can deduce whether or not shes okay or not. Creepily hanging out by the door.
||starzono||Haha, not about you at all! No need to fear!! Only very good advice too!! But yes, let us get going!!
He skipped on out too :D
||.wozwald.||"Who could say - I was just giving my friend some pointers and didn't wish to interrupt you."

Almost as easy as pie really , hands behind his head, he shmooved out after the other, with no other saying to whether Valmont was adding on, not his ode to hear.
||aias_||She narrows her eyes slightly at Natsume, not that he could see it.
"Hope that wasn't anything about me--anyway, I think we probably hit all of the leftover cards in here. And if not, I can't imagine where they'd be."

She huffs and turns her back to the author and magician. She's shmoovin out the door! "I'm going to search the lobby. Come, you two."

She's out!
||.wozwald.||"Yup - We're all finished over here as well !" 

Saluting lazily
||starzono||In any case!! Mademoiselle! Are we ready to go?
||starzono||Gasp! He listened to Soseki and nodded. Oho. Very very interesting.
||aias_||
||.wozwald.||Sharing the whispers be like <:noob_whisper:1030206821463494697>
||starzono||:O. Hearing whispers
||aias_||It didn't take much time at all, she just pumped out her one response and is just standing at the entrance watching him whisper to Valmont.
||.wozwald.||"No need to rush , we've got time."

Leaning against Valmont to whisper something in his ear <:whisper:1078018638428258344>
||starzono||Oh, Monsieur Dante?
Ah. He, has not spoken to Dante in a while. Hm. Hopefully things are better. Haha. Hopefully. Yep. So good.
Take your time, though!!

> <@508392044599705601>
||aias_||"Oh, don't say it like that, Mr. Soseki. What you see from me is largely what you get. Personally though, I think the more concerning scenario would be someone who's masking their happiness with a facade of misery. That..."

She tilts her head towards the two of them.
"Heh. But it's nothing much. Mr. D'Agostino wanted to do something with me is all. Give me a second you two~"

She tappapapa on her device....
||.wozwald.||"Something interesting happen - ? First time I've seen a *genuine* smile from you."

Head cast aside, he walked over to stand next to Valmont , arms tucked back into his pocket, just all the more curious now.
||starzono||Congratulations!!
He also clapped at Sosekis showmanship. He always likes to see others perform! No teasing to be seen at all <3
Oh, I know, mon ami!! I do need to try a bit more~ Hence the search!! It should improve my skills~

He looked to Baeyo.
Oh? What are you looking at?

> <@508392044599705601>
||aias_||"Mhm..Congratulations, Mr. Soseki! Nice job."
She claps slowly and makes her way towards the door as well.

"With that I'd think tha...oh?"
Her eyes are glued to her messaging device. Oh boy she looks genuinely pumped. She looks so visibly excited....
||.wozwald.||"Annnd would you look at th~at ! Presto , ladies and gentlemen , another card secured."

Picking it up , allowing for it to flow down his arm and sleeve , rather showy with the magician around, teetering on a tease.

"Come , come Mister. Valmont - A magician needs to be Observant in finding even his cards , how else will you discern tricks up another's sleeve with reality?"

> <@272423756809371670> <@248897197935034378>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theres one!!!!
||starzono||> <@248897197935034378> <@508392044599705601>
||starzono||`Perception: 15`

Oh, hm, I wonder if there could be anything behind those doors there~ So curious!!
He would join the two in looking by the door.
In all honesty, while I am hoping I find something, I know I am not the most Observant, when it comes to finding things like this! Cards are so small and the mall is so big.
||.wozwald.||"Looking behind the doors my friend - Just a classic trick in hide & seek. . . That's all~"

Humming , he had no qualms though a nonchalant hum as he walked past Baeyo , whether it was the tongue being stuck out or more, it caught his attention, and noticing so the moment they realised he was around.

   `. . .`  

"Besides I'm merely a follower in your advent - Call it quits when you like, I'll follow."

> <@&1213006530828566598> **Any cards behind the doors?**
||.wozwald.||What peak eyesight does to you <a:hero_charm:436057287467991040>
||aias_||Omg??
||.wozwald.||(( We got that nat 20 <:sunglassesvery3dcool:597214750962876426>
||aias_||She shrugs and lightly pokes out her tongue and *blehs*.

"Oh I wouldn't know. I haven't been investigating this room nearly as long as you have."

As Natsume passes her, she spins herself around and follows him step for step without missing a beat.

"Looking behind the doors? Or calling it quits for here?"

You can roll perception by the way.
||.wozwald.||"From a simple glance - No , but what do you think ?"

Tilting his head, shrugging - Looking over at the exit, walking to where the doors would be... Maybe...
||aias_||She giggles at Valmont's jazz hands.

"Well of course I'd play with you~" She smiled pleasantly at the masked man. "Do you think there might be more cards in here? I'd assume that the obvious ones have been picked through already. And there aren't many hiding places here after all."
||.wozwald.||"I just might - I have only one ~ Once I gain some more would you like to instigate a game , you two?"

If they're letting him play why not enjoy the fun, passing a glance back at Valmont, a light smile in his features, taking a bow.

"It's a simple trick , you must be aware - But it's all the more fun to pull off unexpected !"
||starzono||He gave a nod.
Haha, yes, I have
He spins around and then does some jazz hands.
No cards! I need more before I can play again. So, the hunt continues!!

> <@508392044599705601>
||aias_||Baeyo bows dramatically because Valmont...
"Thank you, Mr. Chaput."

"As for you, Mr. Soseki, congratulations on the find. You're free to tag along if you'd like. I have a full hand, so I'm merely waiting on Mr. Chaput to grow his so we may trade."
||starzono||Oh well. None where he was searching, that is okay. Not a problem, many more places to search!!

Congratulations, mademoiselle Baeyo!!
Clap clap!

And GASP!! It is his fellow theatrical friend!!
Monsieur Soseki!! Greetings! Very well done in the quick magic trick~ How are you, mon ami? I would love for you to join us in the search!!
||.wozwald.||"Pretty well in fact - I've got one right here , though I'm still up to hunt some down."

Soseki lightly tucked both hands into his pocket, producing the card he had just collected from the podium , a sleight of hand made it look like it disappeared for a second , casually making it re-appear in the other hand, only taking such theatrical means because Valmont...  "I wish to collect some more , however - So if you two are on the hunt, I'll play along and follow with."

(( YOU'RE GOOD- I dont mind waiting <a:Thumbs:854580710971146270> Baeyo is worth waiting to int with shes so interesting I wanna get to know her more ))
||aias_||Baeyo, with card in hand, jumps off the desk. She gets to her feet and blows her hair out of her eyes. A futile motion, but she does it all the same.

She turns to meet the gaze of the masked man who had gotten her attention.
"My, if it isn't Mr. Soseki. Hello there. The card collecting has been smooth so far." She slides her new card between her fingers and spins it before shoving it in her pocket. "...Has your search been fruitful?"

//Also I feel bad, you always int with Baeyo just as I'm about to head to bed ;-;
||.wozwald.||"Ah - If it isn't Miss. Baeyo and Mister. Valmont. I take it you two are looking for cards as well?"

Speaking as he steps down from the podium, he's just found one as well - Assumed they were all doing the same thing with a casual smile across himself.

"How fares it for you two anyways - I hope things haven't been difficult for either of you."

||aias_||"Hold on Mr. Chaput..."
Baeyo's gonna jump upon one of the nearest chair desks. She's reaching! She's using all of her 5'10" height!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||u manage to glean out some shadow in the light- its hard to tell if it's a card. You're pretty sure it is, if you hopped on a table and wacked it down, u can grab it.

||aias_||Sure thing boss
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Ok, so they are overhead lights, but, hmmmm baeyo can u stare directly into the ceiling again
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Even at your height. it's probably hard to see.... you can't access it, and there's no card there. Just on vibes alone.
||aias_||Baeyo's just gonna check out the lights. (I'm presuming it's just embedded into the ceiling so she prolly couldn't find a card but she'll still try.)
She'll also check the underside of the desks as well as the chairs.
||starzono||Indeed, let us try for more!! After all, I would hope for you to get a pair from me!!

He would skedaddle over to the window where the projector is, seeing if there was a card nearby it, or if there was even possibly a way to open the window from this side.

> <@&1213006530828566598>
||aias_||*Lady Luck is not a lesbian. Damn.*
"Congrats, Mr. Chaput. 3 pairs isn't bad at all. But let's try for more, shall we?"

She gestures to the rest of the room. She's currently eyeing the lights and the window.
||starzono||"Not an issue, mademoiselle Baeyo! I have not been investigating either, truth be told. I happened to get pairs with my first three cards and did not go for more until now!"
||aias_||"No clue, really. I haven't really been around the past few days so --oh"
She pulls out her device and tapapapa

"...Apologies, what I was saying is that I just haven't been around to see who's investigated what. Diligence in most things are rewarded. Even if it's been picked apart, there' no harm in looking anyway.."
||starzono||In they were!
"Hm? You think there may be more cards in here?"
||aias_||"I had already looked around the break room. The screening room however..."
||aias_||Baeyo's gonna stop here on her way out.
||bellboy||cumgrats bro you gots a card <a:defaultgoose:1211913361994948678>
||.wozwald.||Always did want to conduct an investigation here - Stepping into the room with a lazy yawn, vibe was killed earlier on. No reason for it, just a down-productive mood.

But no doubt opted to walk up to the podium in order to investigate around.

> <@&1213006530828566598> **Anything left around the podium? Maybe some unattended to papers, a card? Anything really.**
||elainatime||He goes out of the room.
||elainatime||Some weird energy has entered Xaviers body. Hes missing his usual warmth and earnestness. In its place is something stale.
||elainatime||Well Yuling, its an *awesome* game. That involves a ping pong ball, some red solo cups, and a bunch of beer. And Im fucking *great* at it. Come on.
||elainatime||Xavier turns to Junzo. Hey Junzo. Wanna play rage cage?
||elainatime||He takes out his device and taps out a message.
||elainatime||Yuling, watch this! Xavier chugs his drink. AHHHHHH. He stands. Time to get another one. Want one, Junzo?
||elainatime||Xavier gives Junzo a look that says *are you fucking kidding me? get a load of this guy!*
||elainatime||See? Xavier turns to Junzo. This is *exactly* what Im talking about. I had *one shot* and for some reason they think Im going to start breaking shit! Bruh. He turns to Yuling. Sorry, Yuling. Thats not directed at you.
||elainatime||Xavier waves. Hey Yuling. He slurps at his drink.
||elainatime||come on in babygirl
||elainatime||no perfect timing
||elainatime||For about a quarter of a second, Xavier glares at Junzo. It doesnt look at home on his face. Theres a hint of irritation and disgust, but buried deep in his eyes, is that, *envy?*
||elainatime||roll perception :]
||elainatime||Xavier slowly shifts his gaze to Junzo. What are you gonna do?
||elainatime||Uhm. Xavier bites the inside of his cheek. His device pings a couple times, so he pulls it out of his pocket and checks it, rolls his eyes, and puts it back. Just, like, drinking with Thomas. And some other people. I dont know why that guy always thinks Im trying to get like, blackout drunk. Im just so fucking tired of being sober in this fucking place.
||elainatime||Okay. Xavier sighs and comes up to the seat. Well, honestly, I havent been the greatest. He slurps at his drink again. Youd think hes doing that on purpose. How are you?
||elainatime||..Hey Junzo. Sluuuuurp. I didnt, Um. See you come in. He seems genuine enough about it. (Charisma: 19)
||elainatime||<@555990109355507712> i forgor to ping
||elainatime||Xavier is holding very still Maybe just maybe if he doesnt do anything. Junzo wont see him.. good plan Xavier. This is totally just going to work. just take a very careful slow sip of your drink.. SLUUUUUUUURP (stealth: 5)
||elainatime||Xavier walks in and takes a seat on the ground in the far corner of the room, resting his back against the wall. He sighs and sips on his drink.
||elainatime||this is so yuumicoded

||sadpastry||
||elainatime|| Xavier doesnt know how to respond. He follows.
||sadpastry||(nat20) Callista and Ae-Ra ftw.

She turns her head towards Xavier, eyes bubbling with tears, The elfs room for treatment!! I do *not* hurt people! I am very sad with you right now!
||elainatime||Wait! Wait. Wait. Where are you guys, like, going? With her? Xavier is concerned again.
||sadpastry||Callista is also not strong but together they can do ANYTHING!
||elainatime||Xavier cant think of an animal.
||elainatime||Um - Um. What? An. Animal? Um.
||sadpastry||SNIIIIIIIIFFFFFFF. *Okaaayy* Weepy.
||elainatime||Oh, okay. Xavier looks confused, but not as concerned. No, sorry, for like, if I was implying anything.
||sadpastry||Her eyes well with tears.
||sadpastry||Callista pulls away from Ae-Ra and tilts her head towards Xavier, frowning deeply. What? It is a foreign expression on her face: Misery.
||elainatime||Wait. Wait. Im sorry. Xavier turns to Callista. Youre, Im sorry, I just have to make sure. Youre not going, to like, ?????, ???? He does a vague gesture. Like, when shes, passed out??
||elainatime||?!??????? Xavier takes a step forward. He looks so fucking concerned.
||sadpastry||They are patched though. Sorry, I misspoke. She deflates even more. But leans into the whisper!
||sadpastry||Um.. What do we do with Miss Rhea though? She has no injuries, she just needs fluids and food. I do not know where to obtain or who to contact. She looks up at Xavier and Dante, pleading emoji.
||elainatime||Um. Not - No , Thank . you? I think I. Im not really, that kind, of, guy? .. You guys have? fun? though?
||elainatime||What? Um. What?
||aurelia_rain||
||sadpastry||No.
||sadpastry||I will keep it in mind, thank you Dante. However, if you are okay with my OH. Callistas able to support Rhea easily enough, her arms wrapped tight around the woman. Oh, dear..

She gently lays her down, fixing her hair and checking her over. Nurse stuff.
||aurelia_rain||"BUT also I wouldn't cannibalize Madamoiselle here because she's too cute to eat... hehe, thanks for worrying about m-" Rhea promptly passes out while hugging Callista. It's a non-verbal response to her whispered inquiry.
||elainatime||.
||sadpastry||SPEAKING OF RHEA, Callista leans into it. Well, if you say so! 

She looks at Xavier snd gives a thumbs up in the hug with Rhea, I am comfortable and okay, I thank you!
||aurelia_rain||"OH!" Rhea freezes, and looks over to Xavier. "I MEANT THAT IN LIKE A JOKING WAY ABOUT CANNIBALISM, JUST TO BE CLEAR!! I would never pressure someone into a foursome :("
||sadpastry||//i am fine w that if relia is o7
||sadpastry||.It is the other thing She says with shame, deflating, It is okay! I do not wish to impose.
||elainatime||Um- Dude, you dont have to, like. Xavier takes a step closer hesitantly. Like, she doesnt have to do anything she doesnt want to do, you know?
||aurelia_rain||_Whisper whisper._
||aurelia_rain||"I'll never know 'till I try~" she singsongs! She rubs her cheek against Callista's like a fucking pikachu or something.
||sadpastry||I am not entirely sure me.. participating is a good idea, for I am shy. She was not shy.
||sadpastry||Oh! Oh, shes being hugged! Callista squeezes her back despite an initial hesitance, Oh! Do not eat me, please. I fear it would not be pleasant for you

.Whisper, whisper
||elainatime||Xavier watches Rhea hug Callista. Dude, he says quietly to himself. *What the fuck is happening right now?*
||elainatime||
||aurelia_rain||Rhea goes like <:Pleading:1183095136637427863> for a moment at how ADORABLE Callista is... and squeezes her in a tight hug, despite her numerous bandages!! "UGH you're so cute I could EAT YOU UP!!!"
||elainatime||wait
||elainatime||hes like that girl doing the math
||elainatime||Xavier is just standing there, his brain is going so fucking fast rn
||elainatime||Huhhh?? Xavier turns back to Callista. He has no idea what shes talking about, having only caught the last two sentences, and thinks shes saying barren in the sense of infertile
||sadpastry||WOW!!!! Callistas sad wet cat energy vanishes for a moment, Oh, wow! Thank you! Barren or not, I will put it to good use. I appreciate you greatly. 
||aurelia_rain||IM SOBBIGN
||aurelia_rain||Rhea hums... and nods gently. "There's only the barebone basics in there, just to let you know! But consider it a gift from one nurse to another~" If there were consequences for this, she'd just have to bear them later.
||elainatime||Xavier does this.
||elainatime||thank you
||pulsatilla||<:emo:1201341729241059418>
||elainatime||where is that fuckign emoji
||sadpastry||Callista has been done bandaging, Ae-Ra. o7 She awkwardly stands there.
||sadpastry||kys
||pulsatilla||can you read
||pulsatilla||how to make guitar sound with your mouth tutorial and its not cap
||pulsatilla||HELP MEEEEE
||sadpastry||KAY WHATIS THIS
||sadpastry||Callista just.. awkwardly holds up the kit, looking away from Xavier to peek at Rhea, May I keep this?
||elainatime||Xavier lags for a few seconds, and then nods slowly.
||aurelia_rain||Rhea visibly perks up 
||aurelia_rain||we have too many horndogs concentrated in one place
||aurelia_rain||xavier pls im begging you
||sadpastry||HELP ME
||aurelia_rain||ITS ALWAYS THIS FACE THAT MAKES NME WHEEZE
||sadpastry||Callista just looks at Xavier.
||elainatime||Xavier makes this face.
||sadpastry||<:emo:1201341729241059418>
||aurelia_rain||"Hmn? Oh, it's fine- I can wait! I'll just see someone else who wanted to talk to me if that's the case-"
||sadpastry||im reading it and imagining it like a podcast
||aurelia_rain||Guys I think this interaction is giving me a stroke
||elainatime||Xavier 
||aurelia_rain||"AW, I was gonna ask for her help though... :(("
||elainatime||
||sadpastry||Callista is just =D this whole time, swaying with the medkit.
||elainatime||
||elainatime||When he grabs it hes careful not to touch the bloody part of the shirt.
||aurelia_rain||"Aww thank you!!! And I'm not _technically_ a doctor yet, though I'd like to be- BUT-!! I appreciate you~"
||elainatime||Oh! You dont have to like, do that- Xavier steps closer. Like, dont even, like, worry about it bro. He tries to get the shirt before Dante can bite it.
||elainatime||Um. Is anyone, like. Using that. Xavier points to the hawaiian shirt on the floor.
||sadpastry||Callista just nods and gives a thumbs up!
||aurelia_rain||Rhea chirps, "Good Dante!!" And pats him on the head, or if she can't reach, then arm, in a way that isn't meant to be condescending, but definitely could come off as such.
||elainatime||Dude I- Xavier pauses. Thats. Dude thats. What do you, like, mean by that?
||aurelia_rain||"Silly!! Keep it up and you'll break it so much we can't fix it anymore!!!"
||aurelia_rain||_"Then do not use your injured hand."_
||sadpastry||(MED: 14) The shirtless men, Ae-Ra being funny, her work being put to THE SHREDDER and the spectacle of it all made her.. a little silly, but the splints on, the bloods cleaned and stopped, and the open wounds are closed. It is not my best work, but.. it shall suffice! *Please do not punch the wall again.*
||elainatime||Do you ever, do, like, hand day? Xavier flexes his hand. I feel like I could use that
||aurelia_rain||"Monsieur, do you still wanna be able to use your hands???" 
||aurelia_rain||"Leg day!! But no arm day for a while- NAH"
||aurelia_rain||((I CANT FUCKING REPLY TO THIS BC EVERY TWO SECONDS I BURST OUT IN LAUGHTER HELP
||sadpastry||Callista goes back to keep fixing his Fist. <:four:1048813722778472458>
||elainatime||Oh, dude. His eyes water. Dante is just such an empath. Dude. They need you, bro. Dont- dont smash the wall. Xavier clutches a fist in front of his chest. Smash their oppressors.
||sadpastry||It is okay! You are in a room of doctors! I am just really sad that happened!
||sadpastry||Callistas eyes water. And she slowly extends her hands back to the kit/Ae-Ra. Whenever youre done, babe.
||elainatime||Are you- Are you serious? His brows knit in concern. Do you think they even- Hes interrupted by Dante slamming the wall AGAIN! DANTE! BE CAREFUL!
||sadpastry||DANTE I AM NOT DONE Nooooooo Shes so sad nos she is not finishing anyways.
||sadpastry||Callista just smiles at Ae-ra and passes her the kit. Shes finishing anyways.
||elainatime||But, like, I dont remember
||sadpastry||She whispers back and giggles.
||elainatime||I dunno, dude, I. For some reason I thought it was the beavers?
||aurelia_rain||(10) <:please:894782861675221052>
||sadpastry||=D!!! A WHISPER!!!
||elainatime||Oh, *shit* Xavier mumbles. He didnt even *think* of that!!
||sadpastry||He sounds sexy!
||elainatime||Dude! I didnt even - I didnt even realize that was a real animal! Do you think they have, like, knives for hands? He scratches his neck. Probably not, right?
||sadpastry||Who is Wolverine?
||elainatime||Yeah! Yeah! And then yuling was all like, why is the first aid kit broken! and Baeyo was like, Me and my cool hair are Out! and then I was like, woah, dante, is your hand, like broken? and i was thinking like, wouldnt it be so cool if you could just heal your hand, like wolverine?
||aurelia_rain||"How come you did that though?"
||sadpastry||Wow!! I am stunned! No wonder he broke his hand, the wall must be in complete disarray!
||elainatime||It was like. Xavier does a slow motion reenactment with sound effects. pshewwww BLAMMM! and the concrete was like. More reenactment. wheeeeee!
||aurelia_rain||"Ooop-" Rhea frowns slightly as yuling leaves, and make a mental note to herself to message later...
||sadpastry||I Dante, wow! Just wowie!
||sadpastry||Callista nods approvingly. Shirtless men ftw. 

.What???? Concrete?
||elainatime||It was actually so sick.
||elainatime||No, I! Xavier blinks, then turns to Callista. He punched a hole into- Concrete!
||elainatime||Xavier is tacked. Careful, dude! Your hand!
||elainatime||Oh- Xavier is passed by Yuling. Dante? How are you feeling? he walks closer to Dante, eyeing Callistas work on his hands.
||sadpastry||Callista nods. If Yulings dipping, thats okay, because he was right! Every nurse/medical professional and their mother was in the room right now. Okay! Farewell, Yuling!
||sadpastry||You would be surprised. I.. have my moments. It would be lovely to get a second opinion. =]
||sadpastry||Callista gets to work! Goodbye, hawaiian shirt. Hello beautiful medkit and real splint.
||aurelia_rain||"Hmn... do I look like an elf?" she asks. No sarcasm to be found here, just curiosity :0
||aurelia_rain||"You can call me Miss, Madamoiselle, or Rhea!! That would be me," a bandaged arm points at herself, "I hurried over here since I got paged!"

Seeing as a broken hand isn't _too_ difficult to treat, she allows Callista to do the heavy lifting with the supplies she just passed over.
||sadpastry||Callista is just going to.. gently make some grabby hands for his broken one. Let the butterfly fly.

To Yuling, Oh, I am a nurse, but perhaps you all could make sure my work is satisfactory! And tweak whatever I falter in.
||sadpastry||Oh! Callista accepts the kit with wider eyes than usual. Surprising! Thank you, miss.

And I am Callista! It is nice to meet everyone else in this room officially. I am so happy to see everyone rally together to support Dante!
||aurelia_rain||At the exact moment she says this, Rhea passes over a little medical kit with everything that should be needed, including ice 
||sadpastry||He stated he broke his hand, so a splint is necessary. Hence Ruler.
||sadpastry||Well, our biggest issue is a lack of supplies. So.. May you either help him or perhaps give us some?
||aurelia_rain||"... Erm, do you ACTUALLY still need me help, or does everyone else have this handled...?"
||sadpastry||I am confused. <:one:1048813672170008627> She doesnt gaf about her device rn.
||sadpastry||Oh no! Callista quietly hopes that all is well. She starts to spin her ruler.
||aurelia_rain||Sleepy, I'm gonna type in ur PC
||aurelia_rain||Basic details? All of you notice, at least, that compared to the first time you ever spotted her with the other Trumpets, she's lookin a lot more nurse-ly!!!

... Because she's wrapped up in like a million little bandages over smaller injuries. Tee hee! And limping a little :(
||elainatime||(2)
||sadpastry||Callista just holds her ruler with a.. weaker smile, but a smile none the less! And a squint towards Rhea. (PER: 8)

She stays silent in the presence of the others.
||aurelia_rain||It's an incredibly low DC, I just give you more detail if you roll higher
||elainatime||Xavier peeks his head in. He is not wearing a shirt.
||aurelia_rain||POOF. IT'S THE WOMAN OF THE HOUR. A somewhat familiar (if you were paying attention on day one) woman scoots in the room, looking erm... well, you can roll perception if you want?

She pouts at Dante, or at least who she assumes is Dante because of the injury, "Aw, you didn't actually need to page me here afterall!!"
||sadpastry||She waves!! Goodbye, Mirai. <3
||sadpastry||crab i love you forever
||sadpastry||I am Callista. A nurse!
||sadpastry||Callista whirls around to face Mirai and.. the new person! She grabs the ruler with one hand and a brighter smile, No, Mirai, this is perfect! Never apologize for greatness!!!

As for Yulings war trophies. oh my goodness. .Excuse me, kind stranger, may I have those? Bats her eyelashes.
||sadpastry||She looks up at him like this <:please:1169841201332097085> before sighing worriedly and whispering more.
||sadpastry||Whisper, whisper. She was visibly less stressed with the squeeze, thanks king.
||sadpastry||Callista glances around the room with the question, brushing her thumbs gently along his hand. There, there 

Then she whispers to him something quick.  Other than that, I have not done much! You seem to have had an eventful few hours though, what else is happening? =]
||sadpastry||Callista carefully grabs his hand and adjusts the hawaiian shirt so that its wrapped a little tighter. Then, with both hands, she applies some pressure.

You are still bleeding. I am hoping this will stop it soon, but if it hurts too much please let me know.
||sadpastry||Wow! You silly billy. Is it bloody/bleeding?
||sadpastry||Now to Dante. How did you break your hand? And do you have cloth of any kind?
||pulsatilla||Yuumi also takes his leave.
||sadpastry||Goodbye, Yuumi, thank you for contacting me! <:HEHE:1038291410610298990> 

She turns to Mirai and Dante, Yes, precisely for a splint! Anything would work, but I was thinking about office settings Mirai, that would be lovely, yes. Tape and as many pencils or similar items shall suffice if the lobby has any of those things! Thank you so much!
||pulsatilla||"It is alright." He blinks, unbothered. "I will take my departure now." He's so eepy headed. "Thank you for your assistance, everyone."
||sadpastry||Of course I can, Honey! I was looking for some pencils or.. anything to make a splint for your hand. Do you know where we can get something along the lines of bandages or cloth, tape, and a supportive structure?
||pulsatilla||"...Well, at least now we know." He's trying to be humble.
||sadpastry||Callista claps for them.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||You can see a slide projectior on a table and some chairs!
||sadpastry||MONEY!!!!!!!! AWWW YEAH.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||U got overhead lights.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@901984511892553739> theyre like college lecture desks so no cubbies, behind the podium u find 5 Sterlings!
||sadpastry||ACTUALLY. <@&1213006530828566598> Are there any pencils (even unsharpened) and tape or anything of that sort around here? In the desks or like the podium or anything?
||sadpastry||This is very unsafe and I am happy I can be on site to aid! You know. For when they fall.
||pulsatilla||GOD. Dante holding Mirai who's holding yuumi- He stares at them both like <:stare:970736212266598530> .
||pulsatilla||"Would you mind helping Mirai?" He crosses his arms, >:I.
||pulsatilla||"We are trying to get into the projector room, we are both short... so." `1` He cant even fucking stand up bro.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||dame rolls every pony
||pulsatilla||"I understand."

He stands, sighing. <@305913481113239552> One more time... they try...
||sadpastry||Oh! *Oh,* I understand. Yes! I shall take good care of both of you instead.
||sadpastry||Callista doesnt blink. Try what? OuO
||sadpastry||Callista, on her feet again, nods up towards Dante and gasps twice. .Junzo is already having sex with a staff member? Wow! How stupendous for them! Her biggest take away.

And do not move your hand much, Dante. We will try to splint it even with our limited materials.

NOW MIRAI. *Hiiiii.*
||pulsatilla||"Dante. Stop yelling." 

He looks over at Mirai. "Do you perhaps want to try one more time? If not, then I'll be seeing you." 
||sadpastry||DUTY CALLS. She whirls around to Dante.

# HONEY!!!!!!!!!!

She RACES for him and gives him a big ol hug. Prepared to be flung. You did not message me back! I was so afraid you were dead! Are you well?
||sadpastry||So lovely to meet you, Mirai! I believe we are on the same team. I am excited to work with you!
||pulsatilla||Two people that radiate the sun, blinding. "..."
||sadpastry||Hello! I am Callista and I am a nurse. Who might you be? 
||sadpastry||BANG. Callista emerges from the door with her usual smile, only.. its a little more tight lipped.

Hello! Yuumi, are we? Dante!!!!! He was here! And beautiful stranger!
||pulsatilla||Yuumi blinks "Callista is on her way." He loves floor-sitting and people-watching!
||pulsatilla||"I will contact Callista instead, it seems she will be more of use than the so-called nurse of this building." He grumbles, also tapping his device.
||pulsatilla||"Wasn't he the same one making a fuss about our kidnappers? Why is he now deciding to elope with them?"
||pulsatilla||"......"
||pulsatilla||"I'll be fine... I'm just" He puts a hand to his head, wincing at the headache pounding against his skull. "I just need rest, is all."

He sighs, looking up. "Ah well... I don't think I'm suited for this, but perhaps you both are... I still would like to see what lingers within the projection room, why don't you get in there instead with Dante's help?" <@220287412230815744>
||pulsatilla||<a:CB_think_load:595320605319102465> ... "Bluh." He sticks his tongue out. "Don't we have... a nurse... here?" He's lagging behind the conversation, blinking slow.
||pulsatilla||i can ask im in a vc with her watching said interview
||pulsatilla||It turns out MEATGIRL is having an interview in FFXIV,,

Yuumi reopens his eyes, not moving- just staring, he looks very out of it. Tired. Wughh...
||pulsatilla||She will! Penelope loves getting the pets, even if her owner is knocked the fuck out. She gives many approval squeaks.
||pulsatilla||Little rat leeeeans over to Mirai, sneef sneef... small squak of approval. She does the same to Dante, before hopping down to Yuumi's chest. :( <@220287412230815744>
||pulsatilla||Penelope pokes her head out of Yuumi's hair, she looks up at Dante. Angry. >:(
||pulsatilla||<:deadashale:1028539146429550642>
||pulsatilla||Oh, Miss Cadieux, your patient is barely conscious, his demeanor woozy and sickly pale. He gazes around the room with knitted brows, as though it's his first time here, akin to a lost fawn with unsteady legs like a newborn.

"Thhhan...k....yhou--"

`-2` His body slackens like a ragdoll, eyelids drooping shut. He's back into unconsciousness, cane dropping and his glasses too.
||pulsatilla||"Much appreciated Miss Cadieux," he holds his arm out- shaking. 

Roll social, Miss Cadieux.
||pulsatilla||...

Just as gracefully as he fell, he rises with that same grace. His chest lifts him, as if tugged by unseen strings, to be reanimated. His eyes slowly peel open, staring at the wall before him.

Silence.

Before he turns to look at Mirai. "Misssssussss Cadieux, howwwh long was I out forrr?" He drawls while rubbing his eye, tired, wobbling side to side on the table. The room is spinning to him, but every focus is on them.
||pulsatilla||I'll let you reply and then Yuumi will wake up teehee
||pulsatilla||GULP

Yuumi is it the sins crawling on your back? Or is it yourhealth? You stretch but you feel everything in your body flare up and falter and freeze, is this the first step of rigor mortis? Sisyphus, feel your soul rise out of your body but the bolder you raise up, up again, falls down.  

You fall, sweet Sisyphus. 

Youre very lucky Miirai will never give you up, never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and desert you. 

But as he cradled you  in his harms, the halos in your vision blur and you feel very feint. You can barely move, but youre notdead. Youre simply resting.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||Do u wanna push it
||pulsatilla||`4` so.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Same rolls as last time
||pulsatilla||He stands up! And waddles over...

"Try not to drop me this time." <@305913481113239552> they tryn again....
||pulsatilla||The most Mirai can catch is a bit of discolored skin poking from his turtle neck- I forgot to mention before but he's not in his homeless garb but instead the office wear. He gets cold easily.

"I hope I don't either, I still have work to do." Whatever that implies... 

"The show sounds... creative. " <a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177> 

"I think I've rested enough, should we try again with trying to access the projector room?"
||pulsatilla||"I'm not certain," he responds, meeting the other's gaze with dullness.

Mirai catches a glimpse of Yuumi's worn, tired visage as he leans in, his features etched eye bags hanging heavily, his face slightly gaunt. His hair covers a decent portion of his face, so who knows? Maybe he is rotting under there!

That, and... well. Roll perception.

"I identify as human, but in this realm overflowing with diverse beings and identities, I acknowledge the possibility of other entities taking control of me. Technically, I fit some criteria of a zombieI've experienced death, and I'm not the same as I was before, nor am I whole."

"...How is she immune to the zombie virus?" he adds, blinking.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi diligently retrieves his notebook, meticulously writing every detail, mindful of potential future necessity.

"I am familiar with Cordyceps," he murmurs, reflecting on his previous discussion with Callista where he implied she was one. "Thankfully, I avoided that path of zombification, given my aversion to flesh and my death being something less horrific than fungi infection or partial cannibalism."

He taps the page with his pen, humming. "What is... The Last Of Us?"
||pulsatilla||"...What makes something a zombie?" Yuumi needs to see if he's ever encountered a zombie before without realizing it...
||pulsatilla||"...Have you or her ever encountered a zombie?" STARE...
||pulsatilla||<:emo:1201341729241059418> He doesn't look like this but I sure as hell do!!

" ...What did your mother do as a job?" He doesn't have much to say, as the information is... processing through his head.

"How... does one go through death desensitization practice?"
||pulsatilla||"I am desensitized to it." 

"But... it would always be most preferred if I could avoid it at all cost, as well as the people around me." Peepaw doesn't want people dying...

"Only a month? What happens on your job that makes you witness so much gore?" Crazy stuff being a night guard... purrhaps.
||pulsatilla||"I've been surrounded by it my whole pre-life and current life, it isn't the easiest to avoid for me, sadly." 


"...What is your occupation?" He's curious as to why Mirai encounters so much death, wondering if it's due to a profession possibly linked to violence. Something Yuumi would prefer to know sooner rather than later...
||pulsatilla||"I wasn't ready to let my life end, so I decided to climb my way out." He states it. 

"You don't believe me, do you?"
||pulsatilla||"No. I'm vegetarian." He looks away.

"*I* resurrected myself. I am not a part of the undead, as I am *alive*." Yuumi doesn't get what's not to understand about this.
||pulsatilla||"I was resurrected from the dead, freed from the gates of Hell and reborn by the flames that once tormented me." Sorry, Mirai, he's tweaking out now...
||pulsatilla||"My book is named Stiff, and it is about the events leading up to my death. An autobiography." Now, he turns to look at Mirai. Fish eyed.
||pulsatilla||"Mn, you're one of few who have said that," he murmurs, reopening his eyes to focus on the empty screen awaiting a projection. "Though, this is the first time I've been called... 'cool.'" Air quotes.

Fortunately for Mirai, he doesn't mind the conversation. "I've only penned one book, my autobiography before my death." Wow.... Mysterious indeed.
||pulsatilla||UP TO YOU!! i love him so idm if they keep chatting but i may passout (after i eat) soon
||pulsatilla||"If you welcome my company, then I find myself unable to refute," he remarks, gently easing his weight onto his cane, eyes drifting shut as he exhales softly.

"As for the decision, it rests with you. I won't influence your choice in any way," he assures, his tone respectful and sincere. A lot of yapping for a guy who just basically said 'whatever you want bro'.
||pulsatilla||"Certainly not at the moment. Kalista will retrieve it for me shortly. I'll manage without it for now; I'll be fine," he says as he settles into the chair, letting out a contented sigh, grateful for the chance to rest his legs.

"Oh, I shouldn't bother you further; I've already been quite a handful," He does a pensive look.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi's body feels light and weak in Mirai's arms as he slumps, groaning in discomfort. He grips his head, attempting to alleviate the throbbing headache, his gaze unfocused and dizzy as he looks up at the night guard.

"Thank you," he murmurs, gratitude evident in his voice, though his words are few and his expression strained.

"Maybe we should take a moment to rest before we proceed. I need to catch my breath," he suggests, acknowledging the necessity for a brief respite to regain his strength.
||pulsatilla||IMMA BE REAL. YOU CAN. YUUMI WON'T REACT BUT PLEASE DO ANYWAYS
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Mirari he falls into his arms, like UR GOOD I NEED PINGS he falls into your arms like beautiful princess. A beautiful, grandpa at his age princess.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||Mirai you hoist Yuumi up in the air like a proper cheerleader person that puts the flier up does. You keep it together.

<@162025912227987457> You...are not doing your part, Yuumi, you feel like. Shit. you landed wrong all the way. Mirari hoists you like a prize fish. And you're kinda flopping.. Your body isn't really letting you sit up the way you want it to.

||maamthatsafederaloffense||theyre like these but like spaced out a bit more
||pulsatilla||"Indeed, it is very pretty." That seems to be his only response. 

Yuumi skims the desks, do they have a small cubby inside? If so, what's in there?  <@&1213006530828566598> 

"Can you do me a favor? See how high up the projector window is, I wonder if we can climb into the projection room..." Just an idea he has outloud!
||pulsatilla||"You have a unique perspective, but I understand where you're coming from," he acknowledges, appreciating the diversity of viewpoints. "If I had to choose, I'd lean towards the sunset. There's a certain allure to the night that feels more comforting and familiar to me than the day," he murmurs, which seems to perfectly complement his current attire he wears. Dark clothes and a hat with a veil and shades... emo. <@196879022909554689>

||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh, before I forget. I really wanna make this emphatic. When you look up your points. You **cannot** disclose that information to anyone. This is for your own safety and to make the game more intresting. So make that number 5 more so. It's like- you know it's like your social secuirty number. You don't want people to know it's you. Everyone's point totals are going to go towards this." 

He handwaves a bit more not really important information.

"Now for a surprise, can I have everyone head back outside to the <#1208948110752227328> ?"
 <@&1012808089424105614>
||.wozwald.||Everyone's kind of rambunctious , huh ? Even responses were certainly on the unpredictable side - Maybe that's a good thing : Little known to be an abhorrent chain of results...  It's these people which will kindle the spark for the so-called game that Kazuo kept rambling on about, a game of a life-time, even on business days - ***A CONTRACT WAS FORGED!!!*** <a:page:1004750481446408274> 

Can't call it celebratory , yet amongst the sea of chatter, everyone's confusion that spiralled, the masked man was pretty accepting of the costs right now... This was just all apart of the game of life, fate decided by those amongst em...

   A hand raised slightly though, docking his head sideward.

"Are there any rules you aren't telling us - Hidden rules or something specific that we should or shouldn't do which you haven't told us , if so . . . Shall we keep an eye open for them, if these secrets do exist?"
||helminthic||Uno leans in a little closer. "What did you say?" He totally heard her.
||frooztiez||The top of her hoodie nods a little, she's currently gone fully inside of it to inspect the device. "......yyeh....." It's a bit muted, but she can barely be heard.
||elainatime||Xavier puts his hand down.
||elainatime||Xavier looks around and then raises his hand quietly.
||snombi||She doesn't move or anything. She might've not even processed that. But, hey, she didn't say.. no? Hahaaa..
||helminthic||Uno understands these rules and he is particularly happy that he doesn't have to wear these office clothes all the time............. He knows he wears a suit normally but like....... it's different. His was cool. 

He looks to Theri. "Do you know how to use one of these?"
||yaoiprincess||Asami is also in love with her device almost as if she never used a smartphone before.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi looks down at himself, out of uniform. Ah. Oh well. He looks back up, nodding along to the guidelines.
||starzono||~~Now that Star is back~~ Valmont is going to definitely have lost the race since he was taken by surprise at the mention of a race. Typically, he wins those. Damn....
But, this is wild, huh? Nothing he expected, that's for sure. Devices?? Equally if not more so wild!! Also, wow. Rules. Unfun stuff. But! At least it all makes sense. He LOVES that last rule. He always has fun. That makes up for the rest of the rules.
||aias_||Baeyo silently mouths out the words to that explanation as its being said
||.wozwald.||<:TrollChad:861390391714512936> . . . . Rules.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo keeps yapping about the employee handbook. This feels like it goes on for hours. 
Looking down at your more interesting comm device, it feels old. The plastic and glass are not touch screen, they are all tactile, with a retractable antennae. Then he circles back to this point:

"Okay everyone, and just a reminder. I know that was a lot, here are the things to keep in mind.
 He recites, "Number 1, don't destroy or do anything that could damage the building. Number 2, please do not do anything that disrupts any orbital staff, like the bellhop Lebedev or Mr. Vargas from their work. Number 3, be sure to wear your uniform on uniform days. You're gonna lose points if you do. Number 4, please follow all higher staff's instructions, boundaries and if need be, disciplinary results. Number 5, well that's just just to have fun!"

"Everyone get that?" 

<@&1012808089424105614>
||sadpastry||He kissed me though? No punches here!
||snombi||The sudden yelling from Dante caused her to stiffen and she stared down at the floor, no longer even trying to use her communications device thing.
||yaoiprincess||Why does Dante punch his friends so frequently? Asami is genuinely curious.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi has to lean back and squint at the device.
||aias_||She's already in. Tip tap....scrutinizing everything. She's navigating to the handbook. She doesn't seem all that comfortable using it.
||.wozwald.||He is listening to the world <a:hero_charm:436057287467991040>
||snombi||She's sweating bullets all of a sudden, as she was handed one of these. With a trembling hand, she's navigating it as best as she could.
||helminthic||Uno is uninterested in the device. He's never been a phones man....
||elainatime||Xavier is looking around the room. He is trying to find the employee handbook as if its in the room with them.
||frooztiez||Theri's trying to figure out who's on her team so every so often she just... peeks out of her absurdly large hoodie. Like a deep sea creature...
||yaoiprincess||Asami is poking at her device. Is it alright to decorate these?
||sadpastry||Wooohooooo!!! Thats a yes. She claps.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo is back at the podium, and still with the bright smile same as ever.

"What an opening day! I'm glad you all have gotten to know each other now, so I'm going to go over some of our ground rules really fast, as well as your communication devices. Mr. Vargas?" He waves Kali over to a cart beside him, filled with round discs that only spies like James Bond or spy kids could be jealous of.

He keeps talking as Kali hands everyone one. 

"This will help you all stay in contact to strategize for games and keep each other productive. You can check out the functions on there as soon as you get there. I want you to go and find the employee handbook, I'll explain it as I go. If you have any trouble, we'll help you after the closing act, and just have a neighbor help you out, okay?"

<@&1012808089424105614>
||yaoiprincess||Someone move his wheelchair..
||pulsatilla||
||sadpastry||Hello, Beautiful Woman!
||sadpastry||OuO.
||yaoiprincess||Asami turns over and waves. Hello nurse.
||pulsatilla||He is chilling, cane on his lap and his hands folded. Finally, he has peace from Callista.
||sadpastry||Callista bats her eyelashes..
||sadpastry||omg :3
||yaoiprincess||Asami is next to Callista because I said so actually
||sadpastry||LUCKY! Callistas already here! She moves back to the front row. ^U^
||bellboy||*Kali wheels in yuumi and leaves him somewhere close so grandpa can see and hear.*
||aias_||Baeyo's looking around for Akiko...
||snombi||Soraya stuck with Mirai as they both enter in at around the same time. She wanted to at least sit a little near them, so she gets the closest seat she can get towards the back wall.
||elainatime||I think that puts Junzo next to Xavier. Xavier looks over, his eyes still a little puffy. He jumps at seeing Junzo Dude - Are you, like, okay? He seems super concerned, genuinely, about Junzo.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``As everyone files in, the lights slowly fade, similar to any opera, ballet, movie theater- indicating it's time to bring voices down``
||helminthic||He squeezes her hand softly three times in comfort. oh and he is also sitting :3
||frooztiez||Theri comes in and is like ):
||aias_||Baeyo is in. She's sitting in the back again. She's looking at Junzo looking somewhat confused. //gonna be a lil slow on replies but she's here
||helminthic||Uno comes in with a Theri limply in hand.
||yaoiprincess||Asami sees Junzo and waves.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is here! She sits down near the front.
||elainatime||Xavier is here! He takes a seat at the back, far away from the entrance.
||sadpastry||With the mention of 'The Nurse,' she perks back up and zones into the conversation again! 

...So she catches that question. *Tampering* with drinks? ~~Was Aspen truly that much of an unbothered king?~~ Callista keeps her usual smile on her face, but she can't help but stare at Soseki for a moment, laughing lightly. She's not uncomfortable, just visibly curious. Entertained, even. "Wow! Mister Soseki, you are just the silliest! What a question!"

And yet, she says nothing else, merely taking the back seat. Listening to the Thomas and Etienne with short, supportive nods. Humming to herself.
||bananices||It's such a lighthearted topic that keys Etienne back into the conversation. "There are a few ways, if you're worried," they offer helpfully, in the case that their peer is unaware, but worded as to not trample over his domain. (...As far as they believe.)
||.wozwald.||"Aha, that's right , I've yet to give my name to many besides the nurse." Head tilting in a gesture towards Callista. If one's an actor then perhaps its' best to present such an introduction in a more flashy manner. .  
More fun that way, reeling himself back with a little bow, his arm shot up , only to pull into his chest as he made his top-half lean downwards in greeting.

   "Natsume Soseki , Mister. Actor , it's a pleasure to make your acquaintanceship ~ Even in times like these, learning of our potential pieces scattered is but a step."

Soon returning to a casual stance, stuffing both hands into the business-suit pockets.. *gah.* So bothersome. <:disgust:638410936050515968> . . . He really hates these suits. Stuffy things.

`. . .`
( <a:co_quizquestion:1004786438891634889> )

So a drinks expert was mixed in too , interesting tapping his chin as the words made themselves all the more clear : Eyes closed for a second, snapping his fingers with slight attention towards Thomas again , even if on or off. 

  "Thomas , right ? Mister Thomas - You sound like you know about drinks , entertain me with this thought , are you able to tell if a drink has been 'tampered with'?"

> <@298976980307542016> <@901984511892553739>
||sadpastry||Seeing Soseki chime it again made her smile and take a backseat in the conversation, simply letting her gaze follow whoever was talking. However, when Thomas answered her question, he got her full attention.

*Rocks in drinks, huh..* Callista doesnt ask any questions despite having a few. Wow! You are so knowledgeable of your craft, Thomas! Thats all quite impressive, and I would love to try a tequila sunrise if you were the one to make it. Fantastic! She claps her gloved hands briefly. Huzzah!
||bananices||When the conversation takes a liking to Aspen, the investigator feels a bit freed up to let their mind wander. They remain standing next to him, but their analytical gaze starts drifting toward corners of the room.
||.wozwald.||Having gone quiet momentarily - At least names were getting passed around , that's all good : Choosing now to observe the group that Callista and Thomas had managed to put together in a few seconds flat , someone else with a medical profession. Seems there aren't many scarce , including himself that at least makes three.

   *Exaggerating that.*
Not one with a major in nursing , hell he never got that far - But seems the actor is one with such knowledge , able to juggle it a little freely.

"Ah ~ Sorry for going quiet for a second , I was enamoured by the conversation, it felt rude to interrupt, yes?"

Letting the focus fall onto the actor momentarily.

"You're an actor now , right ? What made you stop pursuing that medical career in exchange for a life on the stage - Where the spotlight isn't on the patient but you instead?"

<@741816012923600977>
||sadpastry||i am so sorry i am crunk AHEM. Acting is fun! I believe that you are fantastic in both nursing and the arts. Callista likes Aspen. He was down to Earth and generally lax with similar interests, so why wouldnt she?

And I know its surprising, me being a member of security, however I can understand.. to a certain level. I can get on scenes faster than the nursing team whilst remaining calm under specific pressures found in unlucky situations. I am honestly very happy about the change of scenery, I like being able to explore my options for once! OuO!

However, that topic has since been put to rest. Her head tilts to the side, and her dead gaze zeros in on Thomas mainly. What is a tequila sunrise? I have not.. consumed liquor before, but I am willing to try! Especially this tequila!

<@298976980307542016> <@357641088208732181>
||bananices||"I'm up for a tequila anything, after today," they murmur mostly to themself, picking at the collar of their shirt.
||bananices||Etienne is briefly terrified upon matters of screaming and or pregnancy, but they listen attentively to the group. "I'm Etienne Tetuanui," they say with great calm. 

"How odd that they would not put a nurse on the nursing team.." they wonder aloud.
||sadpastry||There there, Thomas! We will make the cocktails eventually. I shall accompany you! Is this satisfactory? Well, regardless, Callista pats his head twice. Pap pap!

And now back to Aspen, smiling! And an actor! Oh, how *exciting!* havent seen any movies. Id love to hear more about those kinds of experiences.. Especially in relation to your college experience with nursing. It sounds so fascinating! 

<@741816012923600977>
||elainatime||XAVIER RUNS TO THE SOUTH EXIT
||elainatime||IM NOT PREGNANT XAVIER LOOKS FOR ANOTHER PLACE TO RUN
||elainatime||XAVIER DASHES IN OUT OF BREATH
||sadpastry||GASP. Hello!! Did I hear you mention medical tips? She turns in her seat with a bright smile.

I am Callista, and I am a nurse! However, I am on the security team. Yes, yes, it is odd, but I will help however I can! Do you practice? OuO
||sadpastry||Callista shuffles to Thomas with a softer smile and sits next to him.

Are you sad your friend left? We can be friends instead! :D There are others here too now. What say you, Darling Thomas?
||bananices||They don't seem too concerned about a break. "Mm, I'm sure I'll have time to rest later."

"Fingers crossed for you, then. I'd switch if I could too... I don't have much practical experience with medical care..." They frown, before becoming decidedly more aware of their general surroundings. The floor can only be interesting for so long!

They nod toward Thomas in acknowledgement after making some unintentional eye contact. Why is this guy so down...

<@298976980307542016> @kyaaaaa where am i
||.wozwald.||(( will reply with my bit in the morn 
||bananices||They immediately look embarrassed. How did they miss that...! "I'll have to do that soon then. I feel terribly underprepared in office attire."

"Ah, I just want to do my part," they insist. "I'd be working far more hours today if I weren't here."

A shameless twinkle in their eye at the mention of a drink. "Ah, a good way to spend the time," they lift a knuckle to their chin. "Mm, yes, it does seem a bit distant from acting... But maybe you will have a hidden knack for it? Did they mention what you'll be doing?"
||bananices||They immediately lift their gaze to his, and look visibly surprised by the change of ensemble! "Oh. Are we.. can we.." they gesture wordlessly to him, and back to themself.

"But yes, I'm just taking some notes.." They nod, trying to offer him a closed smile in return. (It's a little awkward on them.)

"How are you holding up, Aspen?" He calculates the benefit of being polite and considerate of someone's response to a potentially traumatic situation against that of continuing to collect intel. He then mentally flips a coin and finds that it lands on the former, before pocketing the pad. Plenty of time to be academic about kidnapping later.
||bananices||The investigator is diligently doing a lap of the room, gaze turned dangerously downwards... How are they not bumping into anything... :( 

He reaches toward his chest in a motion that looks habitual, before correcting, taking out a pen and paper from a pocket on his pants.

<@741816012923600977>
||sadpastry||Oh! It is no hassle at all, I, too, had fun. And I am always happy to help! She also stands up then, because being the only one on the floor would have been weird, no?

Dusting off her skirt, she looks back at Junzo and waves, Goodbye, Junzo! I hope the alcohol is pleasant! She blows a kiss!
||yaoiprincess||She is done walk
||yaoiprincess||Asami is rubbing her finger against the desk! Horray shes peacefully drawing birds!
||sadpastry||Junzo! Oh, Junzo, what a lovely name! She pats his head again. It seems to be a force of habit now.

You are lovely, thank you for being my John Doe for the time we have had!  She starts to rebutton his shirt  if she hasnt already.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Not really, unless you count accumulating lint or rubbing a finger aggressively on some desk.
||yaoiprincess||Here! Is there anything she can draw with here? <@&1213006530828566598>
||sadpastry||Callista slides the hand on top of his head to his cheek to pat it gently as well. It is okay, John Doe. Im not going anywhere! None of them are, TBH, but you know what she means! 

She nodded along approvingly to Thomass explanation, or at least the parts she could hear. *Gold stars all around!* is mouthed in his direction.

Medical knowledge is useful for all, Mister Soseki. Everyone could learn a thing or two! Here, let me show you how I knew John Doe was okay.

She begins to unbutton Junzos shirt again, gently pulling away the icepack so everyone could see. The patient complained about discomfort in his chest and nowhere else from being punched a few times in his pectorals. Typically, just in this context, from the look of the bruising coming in already, and well, anatomy, a fracture isnt likely. I did ensure this fact by  prodding lightly around the area of discomfort to make sure nothing else was abnormal, and sure enough, John Doe is okay! I would have been more worried if he was punched closer to his lower ribs, but that did not occur! Ice helps with swelling and the discoloration of a bruise, so that was exactly what I got for him! And now, we are here.

She puts the makeshift icepack back on his chest. Her chest didnt heave at all Did she even breathe that whole monologue? You cant be sure.

So! Questions? Comments? Concerns? OuO!

||bellboy||*Out !*
||frooztiez||She has her hands buried in her sleeves, but she will shakily hold out a slightly damp sleeve!!
||bellboy||*Stevie offers her hand. guidance...*
||frooztiez||it diDNOT work. She wants to CRY why did it NOT WORK. Her eyes peek open, narrow slits attempting to adjust to the light of the room. She's probably been awake for the last like 30 minutes honestly.

".......mhmhmhhhhhhg....... ookauy...." Luckily enough, she genuinely just doesn't have the energy to cry anymore! You go Theri! Still shivering in her office attire, she'll try to right herself up in her chair. Brody does NOT look good, big puffy eyes hiding behind her black mask. She hasn't even noticed the pigtails...
||bellboy||*Stevie lets out a light chuckle. She reaches over and gently tucks any hair Theri may have had covering her face behind her ear.* " Awe, don't be like that...I can guide you to your room if you're more comfortable there. " *That's the least she could do, though it's a little clear that she has the intention of doing more.*
||frooztiez||Theri had managed to find some semblance of rest halfway through the google slides presentation, passing out due to the positively overwhelming nature of literally everything that is happening to her. At the moment, she's awake, trying to feign sleep as if it would help her situation at all, laying on one of the seats in the fetal position and acting like a particularly odd shaped fern.

Whatever semblance of peace in her brain that she had accomplished (there was none) is immediately shot down as soon as Stevie gets anywhere near her, causing her to shut her eyes a little tighter in hopes that they'd wander away. Of course, because she's jamming her eyes shut, she's very clearly *not* sleeping, shivering ever so slightly as she presumes he gets closer.
||.wozwald.||<:EvilSmirk:852440865421918209> "Oh if it's medicine you wish to know. . . I can teach you in her stead , how about it, friend?" Interjecting , the Masked Man had an array of tricks up his sleeve, medicine coincidentally happened to be some of that trade - Like an Ace in the hole, it seemed situational... <a:card:970187830187933727> And thus the imaginary card was presented. A metaphor of surprises one might add on.
"Though in my personal opinion - The *real* nurse is more suited , mine is of simple works, no miracles included, nor the fancy life-saving techniques they all carry."

   Again - Beating someone up : Not medicine worthy.
   Truthfully all he needed to do was inspect for any bruising.

". . Maybe I shouldn't intrude however - " Shrugging his shoulders, spinning on a heel, head dropping back slightly. "Being beaten up on your first day is rather on the nose, but if it was one of the game-pieces that were seen chewing on ropes, you were a hair's breath away from turning into a snack. . Probably !"
||bellboy||*stevie here...ew. Junzo is still here. Nevermind that. He kneels down towards Theri who's more important.* " hello, miss Theri ? I've noticed your um...struggle to adjust. Is there any way I can help you ? I *am* your trumpet, you can come to me for anything ! Or if you'd like...you could visit our wellness manager ? I'm not sure if she's available just yet but I can surely ask..."

<@373652537024315392>
||sadpastry||Her now freed hand just pats Junzo on the head. Once, twice. Probably ruffling his hair slightly. She smiles warmly to Soseki though!

I am, yes! So I am deeply surprised to be security personell, especially because I am.. quite frail. However, the change of scenery is welcomed! Deeply so.

Shell leave it to Thomas to explain the situation, and shell also leave it to Junzo to answer to Sosekis willingness to be another doctor in this situation.
||.wozwald.||(( A little short, having dinner
||.wozwald.||"Oh my feelings - Maybe I shouldn't look at his wounds ~ !"  
The man teased - Yes, as the other speculated, Junzo was right about Soseki having some medical knowledge , though with a brief lean in, hand on the chin. "Aren't you a nurse , Miss Callista ~ ? It must be a surprise to not be placed on the nursing team. Alas, I'm willing to give him a look over, he was kind enough to admit such faults after all." Following a coy snicker, he'd tilt his head up at Junzo.

   "***You trust me to treat you, ta~?***"
A calm smile eased itself onto his expression, head turning to Thomas with piqued interest. "You know what happened to him? I don't - I stopped caring oh so long ago, so fill me in on the deets."
||sadpastry||You never answer my questions, John Doe. It breaks my heart, ever so softly She turns her head away, downcast.
||sadpastry||Callista peers back at Junzo, dead eyes piercing his gaze, So you feel better, then?
||sadpastry||Oh, Thomas! What a darling name! And bartending sounds like an absolute blast! Why, if I may She parts her lips to ask him a question, but between Junzos surprising wince and Sosekis surprise appearance, Callista is easily distracted.

Apologies.. She whispers lightly to Junzo, even though she cant control the ice being cold. Soseki next though! Callistas head whirls to meet him.

Mister Soseki! <:HEHE:1038291410610298990> Yes, I happen to be quite popular today! I am very pleased with how this is going thus far! One of her gloved hands draws away from Junzos to pat one of the empty spaces on the floor next to her.

Come, sit! You are on the nursing team, yes? You should take a look at John Does bruises! Yes, yes. Come next to me! You as well, Thomas! We shall all *bond.*

Callista really does seem overjoyed, yet her expression is still the usual dead eyed stare with a wide enough grin. Her vocal inflections are probably the only thing that really gives away her excitement, her hope.

<@555990109355507712> <@508392044599705601>
||.wozwald.||A steady hand stretched outward, towards Junzo unprompted, no words spoken towards his direction at first, with a small twitch of the index finger. "My accuser , perhaps you're willing to see that we're in the same boat now, does that put us on good terms with each other, surely it does~"
||.wozwald.||<:nikos:1189341253968597112>
||.wozwald.||A lot to have taken in over just a few moments - Turned to a life-time , now the  , with a free glass vase to fill steadily with sand, the hours would begin to countdown. Which meant a steady rise to his own feet, stretching. Hat adjusted to suit the business meeting as it came to a quick end... Fingers pinched the rim of the cap, scanning the vicinity.

      `  ? ` <a:page:1004750481446408274> 

A small gathering with faces he had known , slithering over to the group, not so sneakily but from the back of ones eyes , may see the approaching silhouette.

"Miss Callista - ! It looks like you've made new friends , and it only seemed like just a few minutes ago our acquaintance became quick-fire friendship!"

Orbs sliding to note who it was that she had been speaking with... Ah, it's that guy !!! **the guy.**
||.wozwald.||(( I'll wait to see if others are chill with it
||sadpastry||// COME HERE
||.wozwald.||(( Hello funny lads, mind if I jump in here <:TrollChad:861390391714512936>
||sadpastry||She also glances to Thomas, This applies to you as well! Who are you? ^w^!
||sadpastry||Callista merely smiles and nods. What a charming guy! Well, we seem to have nothing but time for now, so take it!

As for his question, she pauses again. Blinking a few times. I suppose it was just intuitive, I always knew what I would be since I was a kid.

She doesnt blink now, squeezing the icepack with a hum. What about you? I do not even know your name! Tell me things about yourself.
||sadpastry||Her head tilts the other way, and she nods lightly. While she is still smiling, it seems shes a little more sympathetic now.

I can understand. Perhaps it will be a future venture, then! Would you enjoy that? Callista giggles and wiggles her fingers under his hands.

You must get better first, that is the only prerequisite. Yes?
||sadpastry||Callista glances down at her hands under his, but looks back up at him quickly enough.

She tries to pay attention to the names of the cities he says, but her expression is just.. blank. Its hard to tell how well shes following, but shes trying!!!

I have not, no! My father did not enjoy things like that, so I did not.. invest my interest in such! She tilts her head, leaning a little closer, Have you been? Can you describe such a place to me?
||sadpastry||(CHR:20) She smiles warmly and seems to settle. Any anxieties that mightve been present before completely vanish. Her gloved hands drum along the ice pack.

Fantastical! I am from.. West. The west areas of Florida, by the ocean. Small town, you likely do not know it even if your cousin is around. She bats her eyelashes for good measure.
||sadpastry||Well, as long as I am helping in some capacity, I am joyous. However, Callista never understood why being through worse was a good thing. It did not provide any comfort to her, knowing people have gone through painful times.

Her dark gaze meets his. And theres a moment of silence where she just.. stares, unblinking. . Florida! She finally chirps, What about you? I am interested in the same, but with you. Feel free to roll percep! ^u^
||sadpastry||She gasps with his yelp, but keeps both of her hands secured.

Apologies! I should have warned you.
||sadpastry||She fizzles back in, holding a makeshift ice pack. Callista takes her familiar place on the floor, sat on her knees.

Hello! This is the best I could do.. I am sorry, but I hope it helps! She presses it to his chest and awaits a reaction of some kind.
||sadpastry||Oh! I apologize. I didnt mean to allude to you being like divinity, I just meant to compare your beauty to a certain softness others may not typically capture.

Wow. Lots of words from Callista. She smiles brightly and stands, smoothing her dress out, Alright! I shall fetch the ice, yes. Give me just one moment. She spins on her heel and briefly goes back to the breakfast. Yum.
||sadpastry||Understood! She smiles warmly and nods, directed to Thomas.

Junzos words, however, catch her offguard. Her large eyes widen, somehow, and her lips part slightly. Oh! She pauses again before smiling bashfully, her cheeks tinted with blush. I have never been called beautiful before. Especially by someone so ethereal! Thank you kindly, I am.. flattered. I like you.

She glances back up towards Thomas. He should be fine to walk and rise because his cardiovascular health is a-okay! The ice is a different story. Shall I get that now?

<@298976980307542016>
||sadpastry||Nope! I did not hear anything of the sort, my apologies. I think Dante, in general, is just He is an oddball! I am too, though, so I cant quite comment on that. She smiles apologetically to Thomas. Perhaps I can investigate!

Well, whatever, because now hes kissing her hand and saying he was fine, aside from his heart. She grasps his hand and squeezes it, Oh! Your heart? I can fix that too, if you would let me! Shall I check your pulse? Are you feeling warm, sir? She presses the back of her free hand to his forehead.

<@555990109355507712>
||sadpastry||Oh! Dante. He threw up earlier! *Because of her and his makeout*, but she doesnt say that. She brushes her hands gently over his chest before beginning to unbutton more of his shirt.

I am going to double check, please be accepting She opens his shirt to double check, staring at it.. pressing down gently with soft apologies And then nodding.

Okay! Nothing is broken, you are just bruised. Deep breaths, I shall fetch you some ice! Does anything else hurt? She goes to button his shirt back up to where it used to be.
||sadpastry||Callista walks over and gets on her knees beside him, setting her plate to the side. She checks over his face first and foremost, brows furrowing momentarily.

Okay, handsome! You shall be well soon. Where does it hurt? While I treat you, I can give you some tips and tricks. Teaching you a few things for your job! Yes, yes! It shall be great! A gloved hand pats his head. Twice!

She glances at Thomas with a wide smile and dead eyes. I see! Well, I am here to aid instead! Whike my sources are limited, I am quite skilled! She tries to wink but its.. its bad. Twitchy.

<@298976980307542016>
||sadpastry||Callista materializes here again with her plate. Her attentions immediately on Thomas and Junzo, especially since one of them is on the floor.

Helloooo!! My name is Callista and although I am in the security team, I am a nurse! Are we well here? What has occurred? The fighting *was* pretty apparent OuO
||bellboy||*Stevie looks at junzo with mild disgust. She better get out of here before he exposes himself to her or something. Junzo....he was already so EW !!! She walks out shooting one last glance of repulsion*
||bellboy||*Stevie lets out an exhausted sigh while citrus packs up and leaves.*
||snombi||".." She is so overwhelmed right now.
||snombi||she is so sorry Yuling....
||snombi||<a:tbh_stareshake:1083830025251459132> She is shaking like a Chihuahua.
||snombi||SHE IS LIKE. A STICK.
||snombi||<:hamgrab:817881827905503254>
||pulsatilla||Yuumi hobbles his old ass out.
||pulsatilla||<:emo:1201341729241059418>
||bananices||Scooting to the lobby.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh, you'll like it yeah-" And he heads out, scribbling down on his notebook.
||snombi||Although when Soraya stands, she immediately gets lightheaded, be it from a combination of things. She hisses quietly slowly trudges towards the exit, looking dejected and overwhelmed. "HHHHH-"

She heard her name and that's when she actually nearly fell over. She crumbled to her knees near the exit.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo's just gonna walk out of there, if no one is gonna stop him.
||yaoiprincess||*Asami will always listen when a beautiful woman tells her something!*
||starzono||Considering he if quite concerned for Baeyo's well-being, he does, in fact follow!
||bellboy||" Thank you..." *she smiles at asami. smiile !*
||snombi||She.. simply nods to him before she wills herself to stand. At least he.. didn't want to make fun of her.. Hopefully..
||aias_||Baeyo full on sprints out of the room. It looks like she's running for her life. Or running to something else. Who's to say?

<@272423756809371670> Valmont is free to follow if he'd like.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi slowly gets up, he's shaking like a wet dog. "..." He looks over at Kazuo. "Do you serve vegetarian options?"
||yaoiprincess||Sorry. Asami bows and steps over Yuumi.
||bellboy||*Citrus allows asami do whatever she wants. He smiles, even.* 

*Stevie on the other hand runs over and gently tugs at asami's shoulder.* " please....."
||yaoiprincess||Asami ties her shoes in a pretty bow and twirls away to go eat.
||helminthic||thank god good bye
||maamthatsafederaloffense||the door is unlocked
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo gets back on the mic. "So yes- we're gonna be competing in more games in teams, I mean, not a lot of teams didn't do too hot, but we can make it back..." He's watching people go around back and forth, a blank smile, but nothing he shrugs. "Ooh, after some time we'll get started with the first main game. We'll again, go more into detail...crazy."

"I'll let you guys go get your breakfast, you'll find that in the hotel lobby. In the rowdy room...well y'all know what that means, huh? You can go back to your rooms right now. Once you have your badge and your key, go ahead, enjoy your breakfast in the lobby! "

He pops another confetti. "Happy New Year!"

<@&1012808089424105614>
||yaoiprincess||Give me a moment.
||pulsatilla||o)-( <--- Yuumi right now. "Get off." He muffles into the floor.
||starzono||"Yes, of course! Not a problem! Now, I think we should get to leaving, yes? That could be quite nice. Likely more relaxing than this room is as well!!"
||snombi||She briefly looked over her shoulder and spotted someone glancing at her.. Were they going to make fun of her for crying? She doesn't say anything, only looking like a deer in the headlights as she stares at Yuling.. <:thingy:1036764144390656121>
||yaoiprincess||DO NOT HURT HIM PLEASE. Shes lacing her shoe back on. Girl get off peepaw.
||pulsatilla||Hell naw. Dante isn't coming to his rescue. Yuumi accepts death.
||helminthic||Checks watch.
||yaoiprincess||Asami holds her shoe up triumphantly. DO NOT TOUCH WOMEN DANTE.
||aias_||"No.. no, I'm sorry. T...look, I just...I was just reminded of something *which shouldn't be here.* It's a coincidence is all... that's it. I'm going to be okay. It doesn't necessitate an explanation. It's...fine."

She's eyeballing the exit.
||pulsatilla||HE ONLY KNOWS ONE THING TO DO. "DANTE. GET HER OFF OF ME." <:whyy:825822433956200460>
||sadpastry||Oh wowie! :0!
||pulsatilla||`-1` You hear MULTIPLE CRUNCHES AND CRACKS. He's DOWN.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is running to get her shoe. That shit was so expensive and important that she tackles Yuumi linebacker style. `15`
||helminthic||Uno is sitting neatly in his chair completely unphased by the happenings in the room. The walls could be on fire and he'd still wait a minute to run. He is simply waiting for something to happen that he could intervene in... but the chair throwing is entertaining enough. If only there was pop corn....
||sadpastry||Callista is still sitting in her front row seat.

What is happening is wild! Huh! O3O!
||starzono||He smiled a bit, trying to be a bit comforting.
"Well, I can at least tell that something has changed from earlier, would you like to talk about it? Either here or elsewhere, once the chance arises, that is."
||pulsatilla||`14` The shoe hits him, but he doesn't go falling. He turns back to look at Asami. He picks up her shoe and walks away. He's SNITCHING!!!
||yaoiprincess||Asami takes off her shoe and throws it gracefully at Yuumi. `19`
||helminthic||pat pat
||snombi||..Yeah, she's crying now. She got way too overwhelmed again. She turned away from everything and everyone.
||aias_||She's reflexibly grabs onto the ID under the chair and is just. Gripping it real hard.

"No...thank you...hah...t-thank's Valmont...I um... I'm *fine*. I'll...I'll be fine.."

Girl does not look fine.
||pulsatilla||"I don't care." He walks away from her.
||yaoiprincess||Only one of us has flat unbrushed hair.
||helminthic||"Are we done here? If we are, I would like to leave..." Bro is NOT impressed.
||pulsatilla||`15` He makes her hand away. "Don't touch me, filth."
||yaoiprincess||She pushes Yuumi towards his teammate. `12` Go on.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He does a double thumbs up
||helminthic||Uno does not like women *THAT* much but if he will receive bonus points for it
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"That's right, you're doing admin stuff!"
||starzono||"You are okay, yes! Great work with the breathing techniques! It will certainly be okay! Just keep it up, yes?"
He's trying to be reassuring but he's more of a cheer-up guy than a comfort guy when it comes to support. Quite difficult, but he's trying to help all the same.
||bellboy||*Stevie pinches Rhea's cheek* " >:/ "
||pulsatilla||"Don't hound me." He scoffs.
||aurelia_rain||With a smile, Rhea silently mouths, _'Call me~'_ and mines a phone with her hand. She knows what she's doing later today  Or rather, who.
||yaoiprincess||That is your teammate. Now go.
||snombi||Oh my gosh.. A badge and a name tag.. Another to add to her collection. She did as instructed and grabbed everything under her seat. She was staring at her picture, then the uh. The place got loud again. She quickly put her hands over her ears and lowered her head again. <:ah:845496457716563990>
||pulsatilla||"Her health is not my responsibility."
||yaoiprincess||Assist her.
||helminthic||"Thank you, doctor."
||pulsatilla||He looks behind his shoulder, staring at Baeyo. "One of my members seems to be having a panic attack, unfortunate." 
||helminthic||"Sexism is so not cool." does he fit in...
||aias_||"Haah...hah...no--"

She's massaging her forehead in one hand whilst trying to control her breathing with the other. She doesn't seem like she looks more panicked or angry.

"I'm...I'm-hah....I'm okay...I'm safe..."
||yaoiprincess||Thank you. Asami smiles. Genuine!!
||helminthic||Uno scans his keycard quickly before tucking it away within his jacket. Nothing much else to do here... at least he looked good on his badge... hard not to when ur wearing a face mask, but its ok. he knew he would look good without one too.
||pulsatilla||"Do the perks include being occupied with work to the extent that I don't have to engage in conversation with the rest of you?" He rises slowly, using his cane for support. His words are directed to his team, or... well... specifically two people on his 'team'. 

Btw, when he stands, his bones can be heard cracking. Ohhgggg we love the stone age.
||aurelia_rain||Rhea mirrors his heart hands with a  of her own and grins. "If you were curious of MY answer, _I'D_ smash you." :D
She doesn't have standards I'm so sorry.

March whacks her over the head.
||yaoiprincess||Asami doesnt reply she just stares wide-eyed.
||starzono||He just can't help but notice the person next to him *not* thriving.
"Are you alright? Do you need anything at the moment.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is holding her keys so tight shes shaking. Heterosexual.
||sadpastry||Callista hugs her keys and card to her chest. Wow. So joyous.
||starzono||He nabbed his from under the seat.
"Oh-- Yes!! Very fancy, it looks just like yours!"
He smiled, showing Dante his card. There you go, buddy!
||aurelia_rain||March has on gloves and his hands are clean so really, all that Ka smells is himself. He stares at Ka, but says nothing he can't be bothered to correct any misconceptions at the moment, especially with all the chaos erupting in the room.
||yaoiprincess||I love being straight.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks over at Rhea then looks down then looks away that was not a good look.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||And Kazuo finally heads back to the podium, "And me, that leaves miss Akiko, miss Baeyo, mister Yuumi, and mister Thomas. Again, you're under me, chairman, which means we gotta do a lot more administrative stuff. Don't worry, I'll walk you through it- and I hope you find it has some neat perks too. We'll get through it all as long as we put our brains together yeah?" He smiles at Yuumi directly after that.

<@330260289843101696> <@248897197935034378> <@162025912227987457> <@298976980307542016> 

"And awesome. So beneath your seats, you're gonna find your badges, and then your keys. Sorry about that, I think we got a mix up with order with the Ark...oh, yeah, check under your seats! Maaagic~" he laughs and then stops, drumming the podium. 

``Below their seats, everyone finds a key below their seat and a nametag, each with a proper color coordination. If you didn't have it handed to you.``
||aias_||`...`

Baeyo abruptly stands up and surveys the sitting group. She is noticeably *not smiling.* Her eyes flick between everyone in the room.

She's not seeing what she's looking for nor what she's expecting, but she looks PISSED.

After a couple seconds she slowly and shakenly drops herself back into her seat.

"S-Sorry....I..."

"Ah...don't....don't mind me...."
||yaoiprincess||Are those the type of girls you prefer? Asami is teasing but her face isnt rlly giving that away.
||helminthic||GOOD !
||helminthic||"I don't know Junzo, you should do something about that."
||aurelia_rain||Rhea winks at Junzo.
||bellboy||*Stevie smiles sweetly.* " It's okay ! but do try to keep up with your duties ~ "
||yaoiprincess||Asami politely waves back.
||pulsatilla||"Does that mean the rest of us are on Mister Vargas team?" He still thinks that bro is the supervisor of the group.
||starzono||"I hope it's fun!! I mean, it sounds fun to me! I wonder what you *will* get, mademoiselle Baeyo!!"
He knows Baeyo wasn't talking to anyone but herself. But. He's interpreting it as talking to him anyways <3
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He does a hand raise of recognition, but nothing more.
||aurelia_rain||The man with the fish tie exhales a deep sigh as he uncrosses his arms, one arm resting at his side as his opposite hand comes to rest at his hip. 

"Ae-ra Lim, Lucia Alejo-Aceves, Shiba Nozaki, Ka Aitminn. You are on my team."

His stare pierces through each individual as he calls out their names. He pauses, then continues, as if the next part is an after-thought.

"My name is March, I work in Human Resources. Do not make me regret my decision."

<@237072985318490114> <@273626737504550912> <@678714003983433778> <@297203794629099520>
||aias_||"Wonder if it's possible to be swapped into other teams.... Decor and design seem fun..."
Baeyo is just mumbling to nobody but herself.
||helminthic||"Pleasure, Rhea..." Uno is simple man. Two word response at most, like most men from the old country. (he is not from the old country)
||yaoiprincess||I am full of love and grace.
||yaoiprincess||Asami pats his head. Good boy.
||pulsatilla||"Far from sisterly." 
||yaoiprincess||Apologize to women.
||yaoiprincess||Asami lifts up her hand and attemps smacking Junzo. Do not speak to the madam in that manner. `Strength: 15`
||sadpastry||Callista GASPS EXCITEDLY. Shes on a *security team?* And *not* the nursing team? She rubs her hands together, licking her lips with a grin. She mumbles something to herself.
||bellboy||*Citrus doesn't greet his team. He instead gives them their work badges and hotel keys when they walk up to him.*
||snombi||<:hamnyoron:915076765314076692> At least she was in a group with a security guard.. uhhh.. She didn't know if she should go join them all yet. She's surprised anyone would pick her.. She was so used to being picked last for literally anything.. She just nodded along. :)
||yaoiprincess||Rolling to hit him
||aurelia_rain||"I can go next~" The chick in the nurse outfit pipes up, waggling her fingers at the crowd with a toothy grin written across her face. Her ruby eyes flash as her eyes widen, taking in the faces of those before her.

"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe!" Each word of the phrase is accented by a dramatic point of her finger at four particular individuals. "YOU four lovelies are gonna be my team members~" she smirks with a clap of the hands.

"My name is Rhea and I work in the nurse's office! We're gonna make a GREAT team!!"

<@357641088208732181> <@233964292213309440> <@508392044599705601> <@555990109355507712>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The stoic man steps forward and crack his knuckles, issuing a nasty set of pops from each individual joint. "Name's Faust. Faustine, if y'wanna get real formal... call me if somethin' goes wrong, I'm yer security guard for however long yer stuck with me. Callista, Soraya, Yuling and Mirai, that's my team so yer stuck the longest."

<@901984511892553739> <@272831332059447297>  <@324775830536323073>  <@196879022909554689>  (Faust is played by @/julien, he is asleep).
||yaoiprincess||Pleasure to meet you, Citrus. Asami does a polite bow. She seems very pleased with this arrangement.
||starzono||Design and decor? That could actually be fun-- Well. Compared to analytics and financing. Unfortunate he's not with his best of buds, but, at least it doesn't seem too bad or anything! Woo!
||bellboy||*The blonde girl waves with both hands !* " Helloooo ! Hiiiiii ~ ! My name's Stevie Thompson, I work in design and decor I'm excited to meet all of you ! Uhm...." *She pulls out a sheet of paper and squints at it....* " If I could meet with....Dante, Theri, Valmont, and um....Xavier ! You four will be working with me ~ " *She chirped sweetly ! yay !*

<@220287412230815744> <@373652537024315392> <@272423756809371670> <@310530338294202368> 

*Citrus, on the other hand, contrasted Stevie Greatly. His monotone voice pierced through the room.* " I'm called Citrus I work in Analytics and Financing. " *He whipped out the sheet of paper in no time. There was none to waste. He was already dissappointed in kazuo for taking as long as he did and didn't hide this very fact as he shot a side-eyed glare behind the paper.* " Adiel, Asami, Aspen, Enzo. "

<@240177262140325888> <@195352295783923714> <@741816012923600977> <@237389432930566144>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Awesome, well thanks for playing everyone- I'm gonna step back, and have my team introduce themselves, whoever's the most eager~" And he slides back.
||aurelia_rain||I promise you we rolled for them, they had a fair chance...
||sadpastry||Yaaaaaaaaayyyy!!!!!!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``Everyone else is wrong....``
||sadpastry||Yaaaayyy!!!! She claps!
||helminthic||"Whatever."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light changes to green for Yuling. It stays green for Ka. It turns red for Uno and stays red for Soraya.``

And for ``Etienne stays red as well.``

"Okay, okay, now we're gonna go by reall fast. Hold on to your seats-"
||bananices||Hand raised > _<
||bananices||Oh i'm here now hi .
||snombi||She points at the same girl that Uno did.
||helminthic||Uno is not extremely interested in this game. He would like to go and do digging on his own, figure out his own little mysteries and what not... He really wishes he was eating a chocolate cream pie....... "Ah, I dunno. I will go with the cute gogo boots girl. The bubbly blonde."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I'll take that as a yes!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``no color change`` "Nope! I think I saw your hand..." He points to <@324775830536323073> "Then we'll do you," <@297203794629099520> Then "You," <@233964292213309440>  "Then...." he waves his hand till he points at <@272831332059447297> 

"After that. Rapid fire?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``no color change`` "Nah... sorry, I like your encouraging words though that's reall cool," He waves his hand then points to Thomas, "What about you?" <@298976980307542016>
||sadpastry||She pats his head twice! ^u^
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light stays red`` "Too bad...Man" Even Kazuo is starting to get winded "Next?"<@220287412230815744>
||pulsatilla||He is helped back up! He sits. Pouting.
||starzono||Shame. Oh well. He's looking at his nails now.
||aias_||Baeyo returns to sitting with her legs crossed over the adjacent chair. She's chillin.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``the light goes back to red`` "Nothing yet, but oo-" he gets cut off by the light. "Ah, anyway, next?" <@237389432930566144>
||yaoiprincess||Asami is going to get up and gently pet Junzos head. There. There.
||starzono||He points to the confetti lady. He resonates with her energy, so, positive choice.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``the light goes green`` "Nice nice, I like it, you know we bounce back, a learning experience, you know? And hey- stay in your seats we got a lot more coming your way, next?" <@272423756809371670>
||sadpastry||Hahahaha! You are goofy. She helps him back in his seat. Silly!
||pulsatilla||`0` He tries biting her hand, but instead leans forward so far he falls out of the chair.
||sadpastry||Honey fungus! She pokes his cheek. Booooop.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light turns red`` "Ooohh, you know I jinxed it, on me, on me. Next?" <@240177262140325888>
||aias_||Baeyo snaps her fingers towards the confetti'd curly bob girly

"Her."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo hams it up wiht him until he just default stands, waiting for baeyo.
||pulsatilla||"Cordycep." He says it like a slur.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light stays green.`` "Hey hey! Nice going guys, can we keep it up?" He does an air high five, "Ok next?" <@248897197935034378>
||sadpastry||I shall grow on you in time. Like a cute fungus! 
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light goes green`` "Oooh... right on track!" He does a little clap and finger guns. "Next?" <@196879022909554689>
||yaoiprincess||Asami is still staring at him. Did you enjoy my compliment that much?
||yaoiprincess||Im very impressed that you got your answer correct.
||yaoiprincess||Asami stares at Junzo now. Staaaaaare.
||pulsatilla||"I have no interest in listening to you speak."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light goes red.`` "Ooh...sorry, but you know you can't win them all, huh? Okay next? We'll try to get this moving as quick as possible to get you guys your breakfast-" <@741816012923600977>
||sadpastry||Do you disagree? I am his *sweetheart.* So we shall not agree on this. A shame!
||helminthic||uno has been here da WHOLE TIME
||pulsatilla||
||pulsatilla||"Sh."
||sadpastry||As disappointed as she was, getting her guess wrong Sweetheart? Callista giggles and twirls one of her ribbons again, leaning towards Yuumi.

*He is so charming! I like him!* Whisper, whisper.
||yaoiprincess||Asami points to the judgemental resting bitch face shorty. My guess will be that gentlemen over there.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light goes red.`` Kazuo has a hearty chuckle, "Awe I appreciate that sweetheart, but nah no dice." Yuumi ignored...for now. "Next?" <@195352295783923714>
||pulsatilla||"Does that mean I can leave?" He looks so uninterested in all of this.
||sadpastry||Callista gasps excitedly when its her turn and sits her hands in her lap. 

You are Kazuo! She seems confident! As if she actually understood the game! <:HEHE:1038291410610298990>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light goes red.`` "Oooh better luck next game- okay next?" <@901984511892553739>
||pulsatilla||"The same lady." He points to the curly bob shawwwtyyyy that Junzo pointed to.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The light goes green.`` "Groovy, let's take the next one?" <@162025912227987457>
||snombi||She feels left out if she didn't raise her hand, even if Kazuo said he'll take the first hand. Uh. She kept her hand down. Haha.
||starzono||Hand is raised 
||aias_||Baeyo raises her hand.
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises her hand slowly.
||sadpastry||Callista also raises her hand!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Make your guess!"
||pulsatilla||Yuumi raises his hand, might as well get it over with.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``After all that time,, it's time for everyone to put their heads up! The projector light is back on, and everyone is back on the stage, with Kazuo back at the podium.``

"Thank you everyone! Ok," Kazuo claps, "Heads-Up Seven-Up, go ahead take your time, get your eyes adjusted. We'll take hands and see who goes first- and make your guess and when the light's go red-"
*the projection light has a red light*
"You've got it wrong, but hey, we're also trying out some participation points. When it goes-"
*the projection light switches to green*
"You got it right!"

"Got it? I'll take the first hand, and go ahead point out your guess! We'll take turns."

<@&1012808089424105614>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||```ok, to be absolutely clear, if you failed a stealth roll and you do not want ur oc to recieve a consequence, u can take it back...its a very real consequence.```
```Also, you aren't rolling to guess, you are rolling to get a hint, my bad I should've made that clear.```
<@&1012808089424105614>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``It seems that everyone has had their thumb pressed, some time has passed..``

``The lights turn all the way off.``
Some footsteps shuffle back up to the stage.

"Hiii so we're notcing a lot of not good sports- so we're gonna make it just a bit harder, and this is your first and final warning. To those that played fair, thank you! So we're gonna- well, redo it! Please reset ur thumbs! Ok, redo! " 

```Everyone, again...it might be wise just to do it a singular time now...unless you wanna risk it?```

<@&1012808089424105614>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"So I'll go ahead, oop- keep your heads up for a second," he gestures and some people file in:

A shorter woman with white gogo boots, a brown corduroy miniskirt, and a pink sweatshirt. Her bouncy blonde hair only adds to her bubbly aesthetic as she's topped off with large, stylish earrings and a thick white headband. 

A large, stoic man sits the furthest behind the group, arms crossed over his chest while searching the crowd. If it weren't for his grey, near miltant security guard uniform, it'd be easy to mistake him for a grizzled club owner. Something about his energy gives off complete sleaze. Getting a better look at him really shows off how nasty those scars on his face are. 

The judgmental stare of a white haired man with resting bitch face syndrome scans across the crowd of interns. A white coat draped over his shoulders adds an imposing aura, but gets hilariously countered by the fish shaped tie peeking out between his crossed arms.

Behind him, a near-identical girl with a short curly bob peeks out and grins impishly, pulling out a confetti popper with a bang. The confetti scatters over her black nurse uniform, quickly brushed away by latex gloves. 

A short, gender-ambiguous male with long black hair stands with a generally uncaring facial expression. He seems well covered up as he sports a red, long-sleeved turtle neck beneath his work attire.

"Go ahead and keep a good memory. You're gonna pick one of them, and me! Your chairman, as your guess, okay? Ready? Ready heads down!"

The projector light dims down, and footsteps are shuffling.

```go ahead and make your guesses!/rolls```

<@&1012808089424105614>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||```thank you all, time will resume shortly```
||maamthatsafederaloffense||```We will reveal the team members, and then we'll get started. Your oc will have a glance at them, and they will be told to put your heads down.

||yaoiprincess||Asami is in position and her hair blocks her view. No peeking for her.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||```Hey everypony, Imma explain the game in just a moment ooc, so go ahead and send ur last bits before we get started```
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He imitates the motion for Yuling in the bright screen light
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Aw- I didn't even say start yet, Oh, you wanna put your thumb away so you don't get pressed down on again, cool?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"I wouldn't use that word but you know I appreciate the sentiment."
||yaoiprincess||Horrific but thank you for your answer.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Nooo" c:
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Don't!" C: "Or don't get caught!" C:
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Nope, but I believe in you!" C:
||yaoiprincess||Asami finishes Theris elaborate princess braid and raises her hand. What happens if an individual peeks or talks?
||starzono||He has too many questions but right now he supposed they're doing an icebreaker, which he isn't opposed to doing since this room has so many people he's been kidnapped alongside. A complicated feeling, really.
||sadpastry||YAY!!!! GAMING!!!! I have never played this game before! She gets into position
||aias_||Baeyo is grinning and interlocking her fingers like a supervillain. No notes.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"So to get to know more about our team, we'll be playing this game, Heads-up Seven-up, so just some ground rules."

``slides move to each point he makes.`` 
"No peeking or talking. Keep your head down, eyes closed on the desk, and leave only your thumb out, like a thumbs up. When you have been selected, put your thumb down. Once every one's ready, we go, head's up seven up, and before we start, again any last second questions?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"How many of you are familar with Heads-Up Seven-Up? Any hands?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Excellent, excellent," he flips some pages over, it seems he finished his memorized script. "Again, all your individual talents and strengths are so very important to conducting this research, because we want to really replicate that experience- no employee discounts- well discounts, when it comes up, it'll come up. So we will be running these games, they'll last at most two weeks, or till you guys finish up with them, meaning they aren't playable anymore."

``The slide changes to First Game``

"Now, I think I've been just talking my mouth off to you all, and just to get us in the more icebreaky mood...let's do our first game."
||aias_||Baeyo finally raises her hand. Something's really been weighing on her mind.
"Question. Do we get employee discounts on the items in the mall?"
||sadpastry||Callista smiles bashfully with being called smooth She twirls one of the ribbons on her hairpieces, mainly excited for games! She may not know whats happening, but itll make sense soon, surely. She leans back in her chair and listens with her usual expression: OuO!
||yaoiprincess||Asami is braiding Theris hair and no she didnt get permission. Prepare for elaborate french braids.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh woah, that's smooth for you. I'm glad your ordered uniforms came in on time- I really find that reliving. Oh- oh yeah, uniforms are only mandatory for company meetings like this one! It's just to make pictures easier and such- Anyways, if there aren't any further questions? I'll get into the other company events and more about my team here!"
||starzono||Valmont was also surprised by the response given, he was thinking the same thing as Baeyo. This is strange. He'd whisper back.
"I can't tell if he is in on it or not."
||pulsatilla||"I don't. I prefer to wear my other attire." He tugs at the collar of his shirt.
||snombi||Hmm. Soraya debates tying some cinderblocks to her ankles and going for a swim after Yuumi responded to her.

"Okay.. thank you.." <:help:319323282153406467>
||sadpastry||Callista raises her hand when that was mentioned, No, Mister Kazuo! I just woke up here with no other memories of how we got here! It was fairly easy. I *especially* enjoy my new clothes. Thank you!
||aias_||Baeyo leans over to Valmont and whispers
"Watch, they're gonna say 'Sorry, but I'm afraid that's going to be impossible an-'"

She gets cut off as that's definitely not what Kazuo says
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Oh- I mean you should've made that arrangement already, I'll have someone check phone records for you, just in case?" He tilts his head, moving on. "No one had any trouble coming here, yeah?"
||pulsatilla||"It was." IM SORRY SORAYA.
||snombi||"..Or any of.. us really.. Sorry, that was.. a little selfish of me to ask for just myself.." <:oh:954579164785152100>
||snombi||She cleared her throat. Calm.. down. On the count of three.. one.. two.. three!

"..Am I.. allowed to.. make a.. a call to my.. family to let them know what.. I'm doing.. before this starts? They'd.. probably.. want to know where I am.. if this is.. going to take.. a few weeks.."

<a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177> YAY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A PANIC ATTACK <a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177>
||yaoiprincess||Im not mad at you, however, Im disappointed that youre trying to trick me. I am up to date with modern slang.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yes you- miss?" He makes direct eye contact with Soraya, being sure to speak into the mic.
||pulsatilla||  "Can I go back to my room."
||aias_||"Pfft"
Baeyo's question is immediately cut off by her giggling to Dante's comment
||snombi||She slowly raises her shaky hand.
||sadpastry||<:emo:1201341729241059418> !!! Oh, wowie! Sex *and* games? *AND* International Womens month? Huzzah!!!  Callista claps! Best day ever!
||yaoiprincess||You had sex with her and killed her..? Why? Asami is genuinely confused.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi pinches the bridge of his nose.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||" I'll get into more about that in a second- but really fast, I think a couple of you guys may have noticed- we aren't using the US dollar, just because we want this data to work for overseas investors. These are our **Sterlings**,"

He pulls an enamel, or plastic looking reddish triangle from his pocket, holding it out in-front of the people. "However, we are also working with an electronic banking system- fantastic technology, so you have to reedem these- at your hotel front desk. We will be giving you a **communication device**, courtesy of Angel's Trumpet to keep track of these, as well as eachother, haha. We also we will be giving you your own allowance shortly after we distribute those."

"Now back before I give more details on the games, any other quick questions?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo still smiles, it doesn't seem to fall, but he wasn't really... wanting to hear all that.
"Moving forward!" 
``An applause slide is skipped, now displaying the text "The event affairs/itenerary"``
"Because this is intended to be a fun project- we've decided to run this project like a game. Over the course of a couple of weeks, me and my team here are going to be hosting fun different games for you all to compete in, and just to really explore the mall here."
||yaoiprincess||You were murding a woman? Asami is staring.
||sadpastry||Callista giggles, but she listens, merely nodding to Soseki. The confetti makes her sparkly. er. Sparkly-er. A question comes to mind though, *what is a mall?* She shall learn one day! OuO
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(thanks peepaw)
||.wozwald.||"Interesting questions  "

Commenting, pretty much back to Callista, whisper whisper <a:Teeheehee:784618180965433374>
||pulsatilla||"Sh." 
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Yes you, with the open shirt," he gestures to <@555990109355507712>
||sadpastry||She feels like everything in her life led up to this moment.

The confetti helped bring her even more joy, Kazuo was just *awesome.* Callista whispers to both Soseki and Yuumi, This is *sooooo* spectacular. 

=D
||frooztiez||Theri raises her little hand.
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises her hand.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Any quick questions on that, I'll take another hand?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Let's give her a round of applause yes," Kazuo adjusts his glasses, "Ok next slide."

``The slide changes to "What do we do?"``

"So we're here to provide accurate research and data and give back to our shareholders. What is that? As you know, Malls are a new place of centeralized commerce, and our backers need to know what's best for malls, what draws the American to the mall, and what get's them to spend their hard earned pay? That's where we come in. We're here to give that data, simulated."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Ah-" Kazuo still smiles, but he isn't really prepared or- "Yes, where all kinds of individuals walk, from all walks converse with one another. That's right. A mall!" 

``The slide changes to an [applause] slide``
||yaoiprincess||Asami shakes confetti out of her hair and answers dully. Office break rooms where individuals from all walks of life converse with one another.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo points back and forth between Junzo and Asami-

"Yes you," he points at <@195352295783923714> with his hand fully extended. "What do you believe?"
||aias_||Baeyo's hands are right where they need to be. Resting behind her head.
||.wozwald.||Soseki is currently counting the number of hands that go up- He won't answer. He isn't American after all.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi is trying to pluck the confetti out of his hair.
||yaoiprincess||Asami raises her hand.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"So again, thank you interns, for applying, once again, we are Angel's Trumpets- we're specialzied on finding economic solutions in this ever changing economic landscape. To this, we need to hone in on the average, and important American citizen. And these Average, important American citizen's consumer choices. I'll take a hand, who can answer this, what's the best place to see these interactions?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He steps back behind the podium.
"My name is Kazuo Nishiji, I am your chairman of this project, and I couldn't have done this without all your amazing dedication, time and support. Again we have a lot to go over, but we want to make this as smooth and go as soon as possible," he chuckles, "so please hold questions to the very end. Slide please."

A slide pops on stating ``Who are we?``
||maamthatsafederaloffense||He adjusts the microphone and adresses the crowd. "I'm glad everyone can attend! Today, we have a lot to go over, but let me be first to say, Happy New Year!"

He steps out from behind the podium and launches a small little confetti popper. The people nearest to the ropes have a little dazzling of confetti on them.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``The lights go dark, ALL THE WAY, and when they do, the room is illuminated by a projector screen light, and infront of them is a rather broad man, wearing a similar uniform, but instead wears an orange creme ascot. He adjusts his glasses with a gloved hand, and looks out the crowd with a bright smile.``
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``As everyone files in, the lights slowly fade, similar to any opera, ballet, movie theater- indicating it's time to bring voices down``
||pulsatilla||...A fellow practitioner of the written word... Yuumi appears mildly intrigued, even in the presence of Callista. Perhaps... he's open to engaging in conversation with the demon, if only for a brief moment.

"Of course," he replies, reclining in his seat.
||.wozwald.||"Two of us - Snap!" Clicking his fingers to imitate the sound, casually nodding along to it, that's right...  Curious though, why drag two in of the same profession, it made one question it, probably had nothing to do with their line of work but who they are as people then, surely!

As Calista made it known that she wished to hear stories from himself and the purple friend , there was solidification of newfound companionship!! 

"I'll have to share my works with you then , what do you say , fellow author friend?"
||snombi||Soraya was doing some breathing exercises in the meantime while she sat away from everyone else. She needed to calm down if and when the orientation started..
||sadpastry||She turns her head back to Soseki. Callista feels so popular right now. She cant help but grin, truly! And now two of her friends are *bonding* over *writing?* The day couldnt be any better, really. 

It is so nice to meet you too! I am excited to get to know you more. Kidnapped though? Is that it..?

No, it couldnt be. You and the Purple Friend She gestures to Yuumi, must tell me stories after this. I would enjoy that so!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``get your last thoughts in, the show is about to begin!``
||starzono||He just looked back at Dante, incredibly flabbergasted.
"No, no-- Not all snakes do that! I have a boa constrictor, although, she is very friendly and peaceful! Very large, though!"
||yaoiprincess||Asami tries her best to block Theri from the others. Being tall is a gift.
||pulsatilla||...

Yuumi turns his head. He can't help but overhear their conversation. "You're an author as well?"
||starzono||"Oh!! Not a snake scientist, no! My brother is actually one of those, however! I own a snake too!! She is amazing, many snakes are very friendly!"
||.wozwald.||Moving a few seats down , caught by interest to further speak with the nurse as she self-introduced, a polite one: Rare these days.

  "Oh ? Is that so - I wonder what they'd want with a nurse in a place like this, you think someone's riddled with diseases? I jest."

Giving a small nod, whispering back however, his own brief introduction.

  "They kidnapped an author as well - Or so to speak, a novelist, how rude is that? Natsume Soseki, Miss Callista, nice to meet you." 
||frooztiez||Theri is currently using Asami as a shield from everyone else, but it's a bit hard to do when she refuses to touch her.
||aias_||If the seat in front of her is empty, Baeyo's going to rest her crossed legs on the backsupport. She just smirks and puts her hands behind her head and waits...
||snombi||While she's sitting, she lifts up her hands and puts them over her ears. Her head hung low and she closed her eyes.
||sadpastry||Aw! You guys are *sooooooo* adorable! Remarkable, truly. Like their very clear friendship, yes.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi doesn't reply to her. 

The little rat accepts the pet, but then also turns her head away. Sassy...
||elainatime||Xavier gives up on trying to stop Dante and Ka. He turns to <@196879022909554689> and says, Um, weird question, but do you know what this orientation is for?
||starzono||Snakes?????
He'd look over and--
oh my god they really are idiots. And Valmont thought HE was out of his element being here!
"Snakes have scales, that is a rope!"
He is helping! Maybe.
||sadpastry||Callista makes a surprised expression first, but she nods, lowering her hands to her lap.

Well, that makes sense How is this unfortunate circumstances though? I am having the time of my life, yes! She leans in to whisper, I am Callista! A *nurse.*

She then turns to Yuumi and gasps excitedly before a gloved finger goes to pet the rat!! These two are my friends as well! Hi friends! <@162025912227987457> Yeah, hi *friend.*
||yaoiprincess||Oh my God Asami puts her head in her hands barbarians.
||snombi||Soraya was.. going to sit by herself. She needs her space.
||starzono||"Ohhhh, yes, that could very well be it too. How unfortunate."
||aias_||"Presumably. Or this is the part where they extort our friends and family."
||pulsatilla||Aw hell naw... Callista next to Yuumi- because I said so- He makes a face at her before looking back to the stage. The little rat is poking her head out.
||starzono||He's taking a seat near his buddy Baeyo!!
"Do we even know what this orientation is for? Working? Like, a training orientation for business work? Hence the outfits?"
He's spitballing but he thinks he's right.
||.wozwald.||Taking a second to find an empty - How dreadful it'd be if he sat behind Junzo, but no: As probability notes, he's just picked a random seat at that, cross-legged with an interest for the ongoing show. 

  "I believe it's an introduction - Y'know , a welcoming for us unfortunate to be here!~"

Casually having given a reply to the question-bearer, maybe he didn't have to but from behind at least provided an answer.
||elainatime||Hey, Dante, I think we are supposed to sit down? You can sit over here if you want. Please stop attacking things.
||sadpastry||Callista claps and cheers louder. Woot woot!
||sadpastry||GAAAAAAASP. Callista looks out of breath. She realizes they didnt really have to run so she cant help but feel a little silly, but alas! She was here now at least!

She smooths out her skirt and sits directly in the seat closest to the front and center. Oohhh.. Is Orientation a movie? Wow! She claps. Bravo!
||elainatime||Xavier was just following Mirai, and just takes the seat next to them.
||aias_||Baeyo is also taking a seat close to the exit. I'm just gonna say that Akiko's probably with her in the absence of Mayhem rn
||yaoiprincess||Asami is tying her pointe laces into big bows.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi comes in and takes his seat. His bag is placed on his lap, he looks very polite!
||starzono||And--
Yeah. He should have figured no windows to begin with. This is such a *room*.
"Wondering what this could be about! A small stage is always a nice addition to a room, though!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``And when everyone enters, there's a sign indicating to sit behind roped areas.``
<@&1012808089424105614>
||yaoiprincess||Asami sits Theri down and takes a seat next to her.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``` ```
A bunch of chairs with attached desks, face a small elevated stage, equipped with a podium, mic and projection screen. Overhead lights and dull eggshell white allow the place be adapted as needed. Theres a window for a projection screen, but no door leads to it on this side.

||yaoiprincess||I hope so as well. I am happy to be a part of the better parts at least. Asami takes a deep breath and stands a little straighter. I wont derail you any longer, thank you again. She bows then walks back to the lobby.
||yaoiprincess||Asami pats her back and then pulls away with a smile. Thank you, Ms. Singh, its been a very confusing week for me.
||yaoiprincess||Asami is no longer having a hysterical Victorian woman moment. She gets up and moves in to hug Tiffany.
||yaoiprincess||It does help judging from Asamis serene expression right now, she feels less alone. Y -yes, please.
||yaoiprincess||Asami rubs her eyes and lets out a big sigh. Well, I am happy for you. It sounds peaceful.
||yaoiprincess||Asami rubs her face and whispers back.
||yaoiprincess||Thinking back on it Asami realized she was ugly smiling and flattering Stevie for a good chunk of that conversation. Her body recoils embarrassing behavior!! She wants to disappear now!!

I suppose youre right Asami still looks like shes about to explode into confetti any minute now. D -did you ever go through such feelings before?
||yaoiprincess||13
||yaoiprincess||Any woman but it is far more embarrassing with a Trumpet. Asami wishes she could melt into the floorboards and never be perceived ever again. S -she is the only person that enjoys everything Im fond of and she is incredibly nice I -I would be sad if she didnt like me Is that a crush or is she simply lacking friends? Hard to tell.

I do not know what Im doing, usually Im not like this
||yaoiprincess|| ?        she rolls again to face Tiffany, sliding her hand down her face just a tiny bit. How do you know if it is a crush?
||yaoiprincess||`Composure: Nat 1`
`Perception: 0`

Asami falls to the ground flat still covering her face. No it was lovely and that is the PROBLEM!! She rolls to her side. Enjoying it means that     and I cannot be that when I am supposed to see Stevie today! If I cannot conduct myself in a proper heterosexual manner then I fear I might do something horrible or embarrass myself in front of a superior!

She turns again. I must push it to the back of my mind
||yaoiprincess||`Composure: 9`

Tiffany kisses back and its probably really nice but Asami has no way of telling because after a good few seconds she panics and backs away. 

`Composure: 8`

She falls to her knees and covers her face. Noooooo I cant go upstairs like this Im not straight shes going to tell.
||yaoiprincess||`Composure: 10`

*ARE GIRLS SUPPOSED TO HOLD YOUR WAIST WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT!!!!???*

Asami looks like shes waiting for Tiffany to punch her but shes still going to go for it! Shes just pressing her lips against Tiffanys and hoping for the best.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||
||yaoiprincess||Asamis eyes are squeezed shut rn thank god

||yaoiprincess||`Composure: 7`

Dont worry Tiffany, Asami is just as nervous and red as you are. I just need to make sure before I go upstairs!

Asami places shaky hands on Tiffanys shoulders and takes a good minute before leaning in to kiss her.

You should try a new style, if youre up to it. Even if its just trying to curl your hair or, doing French braids ~ *She muses the ideas, running through them while walking.*

Even if its a bit difficult, theres no harm in trying. Worst case scenario, you just dye it back to your original hair color. ~

Walking alongside. "It felt bland just referring to it as their base form, so I wanted to give it some more Pizazz , lightens my spirits : One ready for any oncoming adversity , I also got the idea after seeing Miss Thelma lugging that sword around like an MMO character."
||kyunu||*Hinoki giggles, following Baeyo before speaking again...*
||aias_||"Hehe, I see, you've been labeled as some kind of *conduit* for the paranormal since birth. How *terrifying.*"

As Hinoki stops and turns Baeyo pauses as realization dawns on her. Works for her because she had someplace specific she wanted to visit. She places her hand on her chest again and gives Hinoki a slight bow.
"Of course, Ms. Mu-- allow me to take the lead." She slides forward in front of Hinoki and walks backwards for a few steps, keeping her eyes trained on the other woman. "Please, regale me with more of your stirring stories as we walk--pfft maybe it'll please the ghosts~"

She turns and walks towards <#1213243441698570240>
||kyunu||"Even so, when I was younger : they'd cry all sorts of hymn and woe and I'd be damned to lay myself victim or thus be destroyed. ~" *She swears with ease, grin on her face as she strides through the exit, pausing at the center- only to turn her head back with curiousity.* 

"I think you should perhaps lead us, and I'll follow along as your bard. Shall I begin singing a sweet tale as we traverse?" *She giggles, teasing as she raises her hands at either side- jazz hands!* <a:0NL_sparkle:1178310230292054077>

He then walks off, hoping Mirai will follow in tow.
||pulsatilla||"... There's somewhere I want to go but I ask of you to not inform anyone else... As it is dangerous. I'm unsure if we can access that area anymore, but if we can I need to look for something." He moves his gaze away, lips tightened.
||pulsatilla||He lowers the device, now staring at Mirai again. "You'll have to keep quiet about this... Understood?"
||pulsatilla||"..." He falls silent, taking his device out to text briefly. "Give me a moment..."
||pulsatilla||"What else..." He's tapping the notebook, hesitant... unsure if he should write this down or not- he feels like he should but... man. <:bun_yuck:1074226076844314674>
||pulsatilla||He's making a face, like he just licked a lemon.
||pulsatilla||"..."
||pulsatilla||"What do you know about them?" Now, he opens the note book. His other hand reaches into his hair, searching for the pen.

"Everything you know, I need it... I need to figure something out..."
||pulsatilla||Turn... Yuumi stares at Mirai. He's still in his pajamas, his hair even more askew with a pen sticking out of it.

"How familiar are you with the staff here?" He's got his notebook tucked under his arm, hands twitching every other minute.

||starzono||And through here as well <3
||.wozwald.||". . . Oh~ ? Same."

Snickering, there's a common ground, albeit strange set of commonalities amongst them, as for the paintings. 

"It looks like an angel, right ? But I suppose there's always going to be a little more than that, let's not leave our friends waiting." With a hum and a side-glance, he carried onto <#1212803669943124008>
||.wozwald.||"I might ask you to remove my eye then one of these days. . I'd like to leave it somewhere hooked to a camera." 

Casually responding , not so put off by the fact. Surgery on the self is hard. "Then again, that isn't a limb so you might not be able to do it."
||.wozwald.||A light hum - Waving up his left hand as if prepared to say more in it.  "Is that so ~ ? I had a dream I lost this hand once : Confronting a man in a forest led to consequences, but should that *ever* happen. . Who knows~ I'd live with the consequences."

Hand lowered gradually behind his back, stopping to look at the paintings as they passed through.

"Do those paintings catch your interest, Mister. Mirai?"
||kyunu||"It's sounding more and more like the majority of this place has been scraped thoroughly- hopefully there's still something left for my eye to catch to. ~" 

"Speaking of which, what type of prizes did you get from those puzzles? Is it just... the sterling coins?" *Hinoki asks, beginning to walk over to <#1212803669943124008> .*
||starzono||"Aha, of course!! We must give it an attempt together. And!! Finding new puzzles seems like fun too! I do not mind changing locations to find another one either, surely there is more around. I have no doubts about that."
He gave a nod.
"I will say, I've done a few puzzles in the halls of the mall, but I have not found many others. Perhaps a new set of eyes will help in finding something that is a bit off?"
||kyunu||*Hinoki stands straight, stretching her arms over her head before letting her fall to the side.* 

"I can't say I have puzzle skills, but perhaps at some point I can impress you with my intellect. ~ The next one I find, I'd like to have both of us give it a try." *She looks a bit smug.* 

"In any case, would you like a change of venue?" *She points over to the rowdy room.* "There seems like fun, or, perhaps going into the mall... If finding puzzles are a pass time, I'd like to see if there are any left to play with. ~"
||starzono||"What?? That is so unfortunate. But yes, still pretty. Hopefully you will get a reward at another point for a puzzle! I like to solve puzzles. They are enjoyable. Even if I am sometimes not great at them. And!!! Then I can see your puzzle skills too!!"
He grinned, confident in his words. Maybe Hinoki is the puzzle master, who knows.
||kyunu|| I dont think theres anything here for us to solve, unfortunately. ~ *She eyes the painting, before glancing back to Valmont.* Theyre still pretty, though.
||kyunu||*Thankies*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Paintings are back-

And because Hinoki is a smart cookiewhatever was here, was already taken.
||kyunu||<@305913481113239552> *If possible can I do an IQ check? (15)  shes trying to see if may the shapes on the paintings need to be removed or if the paintings should to be rearranged*

*Also shes still putting the paintings back in their original position! Tyt with responding!*
||kyunu||Organizing them by color or rearranging by letter.. maybe were meant to move these around after all. *She tilts her head, observing it.* Well, I could keep guessing but its all just hypotheticals for right now. ~ 

I have to say, I love these little types of games, but Im unfortunately at a loss. ~
||starzono||"Ah! Well, there were a lot of tree pictures, so we arranged them in order of how many letters were in each. The next was organizing from most red to most orange. They seemed fairly straightforward, yes? That is why I am having trouble with this one. Definitely a puzzle, though. That is for certain."
||kyunu||We mainly rearranged them to see if there were any staff paying attention enough to put it back in place. ~ *Hinoki hums as shes touching the edge of one of the paintings.* Maybe youre right about the rotating it already looks intentional- wings on either side with a pentacle formed at its center~ I could start trying to *remove* shapes 

Say, for those other paintings youre mentioning, what types of solutions were there for those? Perhaps that could provide some insight into this one if there are any similarities between this painting and the ones youve seen. ~
||starzono||"I quite enjoy having a drink now and then too! But, well. Perhaps next time will go better. Here is to hoping!"

Looking back towards the paintings again, hm....
"I do not know how we could re-arrange them yet. Perhaps they need to be rotated instead? Could that possibly work? The other ones seemed a bit more clear than this one.... At least, I thought so. I don't have many ideas just yet."
||kyunu||*Hinoki is going to rearrange to paintings in the proper order.* <@305913481113239552>
||kyunu||*With a smile, Hinoki seems to be more happy after their conversation- ready for a more casual one to take place.*

Parties you say? Well, I myself enjoy the occasional drink, so I would be happy to attend. ~ Ah, well, even without alcohol it sounds like fun- if not having any drink means having a livelier party than by all means *Her gaze drifts off to the paintings, staring at them for a moment.*

Youre impressive- Tiffany and I have yet to solve this one if theres anything here. So far, Ive only seen that there are plenty of little shapes that make the painting- creating two distinct wings and a pentacle at the center The use of sterling is intentional, as well. 
*Shes looking at them, but cant quite tell if theres anything here.*

Hm- Tiffany and I moved the paintings clockwise to see if anyone might but they back but, it doesnt seem like anyone moved it back to the correct order.
||starzono||After everything was said and such, hes in a chipper mood again! Valmonts thriving right now.

Aha, we shall certainly cross many a path. It happens a lot around here, running into people frequently. Especially in the food court or the lobby, those places are frequented often. And parties are occasionally held too. Maybe you can come to one!! The last few havent gone well. I think it is because of the alcohol. Uncertain.
He shrugged.

In any case, these paintings here Im certain theyre another puzzle. Ive solved two other painting puzzles previously! But I do not know about this one. Hm.
Valmont stared at the paintings, narrowing his eyes at them. Hes gonna solve it. Squinting makes you solve stuff faster.

||starzono||`Perception: 5`

"Well, hm. Likely someone who is just, rude. And does not explain things well because I do not have the easiest time understanding things. And is close-minded. And is not very, good. I do not know a better word for it. I find it annoying, and sometimes much worse than than. Mean people are not pleasant to be around."
He huffed a bit with his explanation, like getting a tinge riled up just thinking about it. Valmont can't stand people like that! Fortunately Hinoki didn't have to see any of the arguments he's been in.
||kyunu||*Charisma: 15. He cant read her intentions- just seems like shes being open.*

A kind person makes a respectable person, and for you- optimism and entertainment are important. ~ *Hinoki nods as she repeats him, her voice airy and words drifting away as soon as she says them.* Those types of people are *valuable* to you.

Then *She pauses, thinking for a moment.*  for someone who isnt a respectable person, what qualities do you see in that type of person? What makes that person *invaluable*?
||starzono||`Perception: 14, No more performance rolls for him! He has nothing to hide at the moment.`

He would tilt his head a bit, definitely rather confused. He didnt particularly understand what she was meaning by any of this.
Oh, that is quite the question! I mean, Id say just a kind person who cares about others, I suppose? Personally, I quite like optimistic people who enjoy entertainment, but that is just me. That is not a necessary element for a good person!
||kyunu||*PER: 16 ; CHA: 15*
*Hinoki stares at him, but her demeanor doesnt change. All Valmont can see right now is that shes relaxed a bit from before.*

You dont need to apologize- its not as though you were wrong. ~ *She says flatly, giggling.* You weren't imagining things, but, as I said- its hard to describe. *Hinoki hums, gaze drifting to the side before snapping back to him.*



*She pauses. . . ?*

I have a question for you. What constitutes a respectable human being? *She clasps her hands together, not ready to end the conversation just yet.* Actions, words, emotions what is valuable to you? What do you look for in someone?
||starzono||`Perception: 6, Performance: 7.`

Hinoki can definitely tell at this point that he's slightly suspicious about her. Who wouldn't be after their first interaction, right? Especially now that he's been questioning her about this thing. Still incredibly confused and concerned, that's for certain, but he has been trying to get answers through this suspicion as well.

"Well. Perhaps I was imagining things. For that, I do apologize, sincerely!"
He gave a bow to show that, at least.
"With everything going on, I just want to be sure that things are alright. I know that it is stressful and I wanted to offer an ear if need be."

That was genuine as well! Even though he doesn't know Hinoki and the fact he has suspicions is plain as day, things are hard around here and he's able to help most of the time!
||kyunu||*PER: Dirty 20 ; CHA: 19*
*Valmont doesnt see anything wrong about what Hinoki has said. She seems to be telling the truth*

 I see. *Hinoki looks at him.* Thats hard to answer. Im not sure ~
||starzono||`Perception: 5, Performance: 8`
These two really have a hard time noticing things about the other and honestly, it's funnier this way.

He just looked at Hinoki, and MAN he's confused now. Like there's nothing more to it, he just is incredibly confused.
"Yes, it is an important attribute...? I mainly meant, why did your face shift when you said that? That is what I am curious about."
||kyunu||*Perception: 7 LOL*
*You can also keep rolling perception if you want!!*

When I said  *Hinoki pauses, curiously eyeing him. Her eyes are focused on him.*  Oh, I think you might be misunderstanding. Theres nothing wrong or needed to add on- I added empathy because thats an important attribute someone should have, right?

*Hinoki nods, self assured with her deduction.* Its important, right? Did you not agree? *Staaare. . . ? ? ?*

Theres really nothing else to it. ~
||starzono||> You can continue to roll perception if you want :)
||starzono||"Oh, it was just when you said 'empathy,' that you sort of adjusted your expression a bit. In the eyes. I just wondered if there was anything you wanted to add-on from there? I couldn't help but notice it, so I figured I would ask rather than assume."
He is being completely honest here, and he's clearly more concerned now as she laughed.

"It is alright to try and find something fun out of everything else, I do that all of the time, as do many others here. So, if you do want to share, I am open to listening."
Valmont smiles and stares back. He doesn't need an answer or anything, but he wouldn't mind getting one either. But, he's trying to be friendly above all else.
||kyunu||*Hinoki stares at him for a moment, but... she doesn't feel that anything is wrong. An innocent question, she supposes, but what about her changed? She wasn't sure.* 

"I don't know what you're talking about-" *. . . ? ? ? ?* "... Something changed? I don't think I said anything wrong." *She reiterates- but, after a pause- she laughs.* 

"Aha... sorry- there really isn't *anything* on my mind. Of course I'm worried about this place-" *Isn't everyone?* "I'm just trying to find some fun in a, confusing situation. ~" *What did she say that was wrong?* 

*Hinoki smiles, and she's staring.*
||starzono||Genuine curiosity from this guy. With a hint of concern. He's just a bit inquisitive!!
`Performance: 21`

||starzono||Suresies <3
||kyunu||*Can I roll perception* 
||starzono||"Ah, it was just when you said something, I noticed you changed slightly. You have not said anything wrong, but it was in your expression. I know you are new here, so I wanted to ask if there was something else on your mind?"
He answered simply, looking more curious than suspicious at the very least.
||kyunu||*Hinoki blinks, tilting her head downward slightly as she looks up at him. After a moment of silence, she tilts her head to the side, scanning him.* 

"What do you mean?" *She says flatly, though immediately after she raises her head, smile across her face and a blank stare.* "I'm not sure I said anything wrong, have I? I apologize if so." 

*Hinoki is just looking at him, curious. . .?*
||starzono||He placed what it was that made her sound a bit off. At least, a single word that pointed it out. His eyes narrowed a bit, looking towards her.
"Pardon the change of topic, mademoiselle, but, is something the matter?"

Valmont isn't quite sure if he should be telling her all these things anymore. He doesn't mind doing so, sure, but also, something does not seem right now.
||kyunu||*Also end of the perception games * <:devious:1215529624247861319>
||kyunu||*Charisma: 8- Loss! To the dms.*

I would really hope that empathy and teamwork can be something that everyone here can agree to- perhaps that way, we may find a way to escape here sooner. ~

*Hinoki nods, placing her hand on her chest. She fidgets with her brooch, delicately touching it.*

Prizes from the sky? Now, that sounds even more interesting. Does it simply- fall out of thin air and in front of you? I suppose its nice to be rewarded for our efforts but it only serves to normalize the strangeness of this place
||starzono||`Perception: 13`

Hm... Maybe she was genuine after all. Maybe there isn't anything to be concerned about? Maybe it's nothing at all! That's probably it.

"Of course!!! Teamwork makes the dream work, they say! Good phrase, I think. I've heard it before and I think it is a good motto. Indeed. If we are all on the same side, then nothing can make us turn against one another!!"
He nods assuredly at his own words with a bright smile.

"Yes.... Unfortunately, sometimes it is plastic. Very strange, is it not? Also, some puzzles here, we get prizes from the sky. Or, well, the ceiling. Basically the sky here, though. Sometimes there's passwords for the computers. Sometimes there's money to be used in this place. Not much, but, it is something? I cannot place many more strange things *like* that, but it is just strange in general."
||kyunu||*Charisma: Nat 25 Hinoki seems to be very flattered that Valmont is talking to her- enjoying their conversation, shes keen on hanging on to every word that he says, content that it matches with her own thoughts.*

I believe given the situation, its important for all of us to stay connected with one another- at least on the wavelength that were in this *job* together. Teamwork and camaraderie are tools of the trade that require cooperation and thoughtful communication. ~

*She blinks, surprised.* It *is* plastic? Thats a cruel way to treat us. Hardly the motivation to keep working, though not that we have a choice in doing what they ask. Is there anything else here that seems strange in that way? ~
||starzono||`Perception: 10`

"Aha, of course! I do like to think I am on good terms with nearly everyone here. Which is pleasant."

"No, no, not *like* plastic. It *is* plastic. Like. Taunting us with a lot more fake food than you would imagine. Apparently, it is a game for us to find it. Which is ridiculous."

He can't quite put his finger on it, but something is off. *Something*. What in the world *is* it? He's trying to figure it out. Hmmm...
||kyunu||<@272423756809371670>
||kyunu||*Charisma: 18. To dms!*

You dont mind speaking to me? ~ My, Im flattered. This is the most Ive talked to others in a while- I do appreciate idle chit-chat now and again ~ *She laughs lightly, placing her hands behind her back again.*

Almost like plastic? Its awful that theyd serve such food here- if were employees, it certainly feels that we are bottom of the barrel in terms of whether or not they care of our overall health.
||starzono||`Perception: 18. He might finally see SOMETHING this time.`

"Maybe there is nothing to it, you may be right. Who knows! But, yes, I do not mind speaking with you at all."
He'd give a bow, before looking back up.

"Oh, certainly. The food is, well. On occasion it is quite good! Most of the time, though? Plastic. Trash. Disgusting concoctions. It's very unfortunate."
||kyunu||My current guess is that perhaps there *is* no rhyme or reason as to why any of us were selected. ~ *She shrugs, folding her arms together.* 

Well- thank you regardless for taking the time to speak with me Of course- I will remain vigilant in being respectful of the topic. ~ And their boundaries thereafter, anyways. *Hinoki nods, faint smile twisting into a grin.* I had quite the most delicious lunch in the food court, where I learned that theres a chance of a sour meal. After eating I feel *much* better. ~
||starzono||`Perception: 6`

"Ah, yes!! Lynceus is very very nice. A good friend! Very helpful too! I am glad you have been able to talk to him at least."
Nod nod!

"I've been trying to figure at least something out that possibly connects us all, though, I cannot find a connection that makes sense. Not yet, at least. A work in progress."

Yet another sigh, but, well, after that he did notice, something. Just a bit that gave a slight hint on how she actually felt regarding it all. Or at least, what *he* is interpreting is how she really feels. 
"Mademoiselle Hinoki, I do understand that it is a bit confusing, the whole zombie thing, that is. I do not really get it entirely myself, but I know that it is a concern for my friends, so it is important to take seriously. Again, I know you were unaware of that, so, it is not an issue I think. Just, a thing to be mindful of. I am glad that you are alright, though, all things considered!"
||kyunu||*Charisma: 8. To dms!*

I havent met Kali, *Hinoki nods, committing the name to memory* But I have met Lynceus- hes been the one to answer most of my questions so far, and quite kind too. ~

*Hinoki giggles at his comment, taking a quick glance back to his attire. That made perfect sense!* I see, so our reason for being here will just stay, vague Thats too bad. ~ *That sounds like fun.*

With supernatural creatures such as zombies, Ill leave it to the experts- Im afraid I know nothing of how to handle that type of situation ~ And yes, Xavier had asked if I was bitten- and so I replied, but he ran off after I mentioned asking for a doctor. I wasnt feeling too well after- so his mention of a bite made me think that mustve been the case, so I was worried, perhaps, I had got bitten by a poisonous spider. ~ 

*She breathes in.*

It ended up not being anything serious, and I must have daydreamed a bite- I realized instead that I was simply cold and quite hungry. ~ By the time I had realized that though, it was well after our fight.
||starzono||> <@131145091178954752>
||starzono||`Perception: 8`

"Radio silence from the staff, well, that is not great. Lynceus and Monsieur Kali are rather helpful if you call up the front desk from your phone in the room, or if you just go up to either when they are at the desk. Sometimes they do not have the answers, but, they communicate with the Trumpets more than the rest of us do."

"Though, well, none of us really know why we are here either. I certainly do not know why I am here. All I know is that we are apparently 'employees' here. Though, I am *not* one to work in a lot of environments, including this one."
He shrugged, sighing a bit at that. I mean, it's good to assume that Valmont wouldn't typically work in a place like this. Wizard hat, big robe, crop top, tights, jazz shoes. Not really attire one wears to work.

"And, yes. Zombies. So far not an issue, but, well. Who knows. I'm not an expert like Mirai is, and they are very strong and know how to handle the undead! I think I heard something about being bitten, and that is where the miscommunication was held? Yes? Generally just, not a great thing to have conflict over, especially since we aren't allowed to leave, for whatever reason."
||kyunu||*Charisma: 19. Hinoki seems like she was pretty upset by thinking she was going to get hurt- though theres remorse in her words as she mourns the would-be friendship.*

*Hinoki shakes her head, eyes glimmering as her eyes trace over the communicator. While not a cellphone, she definitely wants one.*
Oh! Thats a relief- I was worried that we wouldnt be able to well, use any type of device to communicate outside of the rotary phone in our rooms. ~ *She smiles. (:* We havent received one- or actually, anything. We still dont know why were here- weve been told bits and pieces by kind individuals but so far, radio silence from staff. ~ 

And, *thank you* for the reassurance. Hopefully, we can make amends but, I understand if that ends not happening- *Hinoki pauses, raising an eyebrow.*  Hold on, **zombies**? Thats what that- oh. goodness  *She unfolds her hands from her back and places her hand on her head.*

I suppose something like that can very well happen here. ~ Ill be more careful with my words.
||starzono||"Well, locating you cannot do, but, you do not have a way to contact them? Were you not given communicators?"
He grabbed his, holding it up and waving it a bit.
"You are able to message other people here with it, like texting! In a way."

"But, yes, they were upset regarding the whole situation. Zombies are not something that should be joked around with, just something to keep in mind for the future! You had no way of knowing that, though, so I think it is going to be alright. I hope."
Valmont nods with a smile, he's trying his best to provide at least some context without saying anything too personal.
"They are very good friends, though. And if you do run into them, I would just take things very calmly and such!!"

`Perception: 9`
||kyunu||*You can keep rolling perception throughout their interaction too if you want lol*
||kyunu||*She raises her head, still with a faint smile on her face. Still with her hands closed behind her back, she sighs.*

Im open to apologies, though, Im afraid they wouldnt want to hear anything of sort from myself. ~ There isnt a way for me to contact, or locate them either. *Hinoki hums, swaying side by side.* I hadnt realized it sooner, since they seemed so upset from the get-go. Honestly I was afraid I was going to get hurt- but, I *poorly* misjudged the situation. The consequences speak for itself- losing two people who could have just as easily been friends in the place. A pity.
||starzono||"Aha, yes, there is a lot of painting puzzles here. It is quite the oddity. I am sure it is solve-able, but, hm..."
He looked back at the paintings for a moment. He will definitely have to try to solve this one, for sure.

Well, she seemed genuine enough in her apology! He was definitely suspicious of her before, and he still is, but, at least she apologized and that is what matters here.
"Yes... I am afraid that tensions are quite high and it was just, not the best circumstances. The topic is actually very, well... Sensitive? I suppose? And it was not great. I think it is Mirai and Xavier who need to hear the apology more than I do, but I appreciate it nonetheless, however."
||kyunu||*Charisma : 10*

*It doesnt look like shes lying at least. Its a genuine apology.*
||starzono||`Perception: 3...`
||kyunu||*Hinoki appears to be rather calm despite what happened earlier. Placing her hands behind her back as Valmont introduces himself, tilting her head slightly to the side. His cheerful demeanor only made her more curious- especially his outgoing twirl.*

Valmont Chaput, its a pleasure to meet you. ~ *She bows her head slightly to him.*

That so? It looks like Tiffany and I missed something then. ~ I didnt see a hidden message or code but, perhaps well try again later *She pauses, glancing to the painting, and then back to him. Now then*

*. . .*

Valmont, Id like to clear the air. *She begins- sucking in a breath.* I dont believe we had the best introduction when we first arrived. I apologize for my behavior- and actions earlier. *Hinoki bows her head down to him again. Feel free to roll perception!*
||starzono||Well, considering she answered with a happy tone and such, he decides he won't be on the defensive, at least, not yet. Hopefully everything was truly a misunderstanding and since it was diffused, there's no reason to be angry. Hopefully.

Since she introduced herself, he would give a smile in return.
"Ah, a pleasure to meet you officially, mademoiselle Hinoki. I am--"
He would spin around and pose!!
"Valmont Chaput~!"
Jazz hands  

"I see you are looking towards the paintings. There's been a few other puzzles solved regarding various paintings, but, I must have missed this one. There were other abstract pieces made by Lebedev elsewhere as well. It is definitely a puzzle of some sort, the other paintings were puzzles too."
||kyunu||*Hinoki, who had been drawn to observing the paintings only turns to face Valmont upon hearing his foot steps. Her eyes focus on him for a moment- recognizing him, but turning her attention back to the paintings.*

Well, I had been hopeful that perhaps this were a puzzle- like the room I arrived in ~ *She sighs, though she seems happy.*  But, all Ive learned is that theyre signed by Lebedev. Perhaps a relative of Lynceus 

*She muses, facing him once again with a smile.* We met earlier, Im sure you remember. My name is Hinoki Mu- and you?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theyre as you left them~
||kyunu||So sorry Im stuck in work meetings almost out )
||starzono||> <@131145091178954752>
||starzono||Throughsi--
He'd stop, seeing Hinoki. Ah. Her.
Glancing over to what she was looking at, he was shocked. Oh my god. The Tree-o missed some paintings. Valmont quickly walked over to Hinoki's side, regardless of his feelings regarding her, inspecting the paintings.

"...Have you found anything out about these paintings yet?"
||kyunu||*Those paintings are pretty. Shes staring at them.* 
||kyunu||*Waddles into here as originally intended, so sorry for the double ping JAJCJSJSKSK*

*Hinoki comes back in here, looking at the paintings- have they been put back into place since they rearranged them?* <@305913481113239552>

||kyunu||*Better than nothing! She'll take it with her for now, unfortunate that there's nothing else...* 

*She'll close the door to the storage closet, but she's going to look at the plaques near the meeting room doors. Do any of them look removable?*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Its like yah
||kyunu||*Like a 2ft one*
||kyunu||*I'm sorry I don't know ace attorney ;; Does that mean it's much shorter than her? She's 5'7"*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theres a step ladder (a short one and an ace attorney definition of one), but there isnt any hardware or scissors. just some strong cleaning supplies bc 1969 is loose with regulations. The shelves are shelves that are drilled in.
||kyunu||*Back here, and immediately walking over to look in the closet.*
  

*Firstly, are there any any hand tools, such as drills- hammers, even a plunger. Scissors, and the like- anything that would make sense for a janitor's utility closet...* 

*She also is going to look for any type of ladder, or if the shelves are a utility shelf detached from the wall.* <@305913481113239552>
||kyunu||*Hopping in the shower rq, she'll follow Tiffany until I'm back to respond if you're okay with that!! Hopefully I'm quick* ]
||kyunu||"Alright then... We have a few places we can go to. Either back to the mall, the <#1212802542778449963> , <#1213243441698570240> , or to talk to Lynceus. I'm comfortable with any of these options... ~ " *She pauses.* "Well, the room where the fight happened might be intimidating. ~"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Paintings have been displaced!
||kyunu||<@305913481113239552>  *Together, Tiff and Hinoki rotate the paintings clock wise on the wall- just to displace them. (:*
||kyunu||"That's true. ~ But, we could just crash their party." *She's certain with how talkative Natsume is, they'll be there for a while...* 

"Well, I'll help you rearrange them. ~ If one of the staff moves it back to it's original spot, then that means someone cares about the paintings, or simply wants to keep things in order here. How about rotating it clockwise?"
||kyunu||*Hinoki is looking at the paintings, and for the first time since she's been here- she looks a little disappointed that nothing pops out to her immediately. Though, her trademark smile is still there. Hearing Tiff's comment, her interest is piqued.* 

"Really? ~" *She peers over to her, tilting her head- before pulling out her own chip to look at it.* "I wonder why they would decide to theme the paintings around it. Perhaps it's a hint towards the purpose of this place. ~" *Hinoki looks back to the painting.* "I would certainly like to ask Lynceus more, but, would you like to take some more time to look at the paintings?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||The painting, as in the paint themselves make a pentacle, the way they are hung makes a triangle shape, with the middle one just a bit higher than the other two. But no other codes or hidden messages!
||maamthatsafederaloffense||It was probably commissioned around this Sterling, probably not the other way around, the shapes of the individual triangles are so close to a Sterlings, it doesnt make sense any other way. 
As for the phrase, maybe it has to do with something religious then?
||kyunu||`18`
||kyunu||*She's going to check if there's a hidden message or code forming inside of the many shapes of the paintings!* 

*Side question, when you say pentacles do you mean like the star? The center painting looks like a triangle but the description says it makes a big pentacle.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Nothing else in that reddish color. But go ahead roll an iq for some conclusion drawing
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Sure! What are you looking for?
||kyunu||*Hinoki peeks over to look at the painting- her mouth forming a little 'o' as she sees the signature.* "Oh! Then... That must mean his family could be more involved with this place than we know." *She nods.* "It's fun coincidence that someone from his family's paintings are there. Though, it'd be quite impressive if it was done by Lynceus himself- it's so intricate. ~" 

*Hinoki takes a closer look at the paintings... Can I try a perception check on the painting itself? :0* <@305913481113239552>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||While there may be nothing on the backside, doing the motion makes the signature obvious, made by a Lebedev.
||kyunu||"You know, it would be fun if this entire place was just a giant escape room. ~" *Her eyes trace over the paintings, looking over to Tiffany.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<finally an excuse to get this out of pc c hannels>

They're made out of abstract shapes 
The colors are very warm...Lots of triangles used in these pieces. They have some globs of red paint to them, the shade familar to the Sterlings.

Some resemble pentacles, and two, are two triangle mosaics like paint, where they form wings. 

Pentacles, wings, triangles..

from left to right
painting one: made up of small triangles on close examination, which makes some pentacles, which makes a giant wing (left)
painting two: made up of small triangles on close examination, when zooming out, it is a giant pentacle.
painting three: made up of small triangles on close examination, which makes some pentacles, which makes a giant wing (right)

oh , and they are moveable!
||kyunu||"Well, I suppose we could go to the <#1212802542778449963> , or the <#1213243441698570240>  if we want to see if the Chairman is still there. ~ Or just walk to the mall... What do you think?"

*She'll walk back over to Tiffany to look at the art pieces- are there multiple, and if so do they look loose on the wall?*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||the mall sign can't be removed as of right now
||kyunu||"Hm, nothing fun in here. ~ Just cleaning supplies... " *She deliberates for a moment, before closing the storage closet door. Turning back to the hall, she walks over to the art piece.* 

"Anything interesting over there?" *She calls to Tiffany, who she caught eye of investigating the paintings.* 

*Hinoki walks over to the mall sign, can the mall sign be removed from it's spot?*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||it opens! its anormal janitor's closet...just  missing a mop. <eating a fish burrito, slow>
||kyunu||*Hinoki wanders here.* "Now this looks fun. ~ I believe we walked through here from... there." *She points to <#1213243441698570240> .* 

"That's where that fight happened, I'm sure. Looks like there's another room, pathway, and a closet... oh, and the art. ~" 

*Hinoki walks over to the closet, giving it a little jiggle. Does it open?* <@305913481113239552>

||aias_||"Well you're free to follow. I still have questions for the chairman though."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo keeeps on walking
||aias_||She's been walking next to Kazuo this whole time
||aias_||Is Dante walking with them?
||aias_||She looks at his hand and eyeballs it. What did he intend to have her do? Stop? What more can he ask of her, despite everything, her self restraint has been commendable.

She doesn't take his hand.

"Why is everyone assuming I'm trying to fight the staff right now!? I'm *just* trying to talk, Dante. As it stands, between the instability of the building, whatever was hidden in *that room* in the tunnels, the fact that the higher ups are more than willing to throw us into said unstable building and watch as we die, the missing people and the fact that Ae-ra Lim is here, I just... I *need* answers."

She looks over at Kazuo and back to Dante. "...And unfortunately, some questions can only get answered by the chairman, though...I have less faith that he knows what goes on in his own mall."

In a much quieter voice she softly addresses Dante. "...I'm scared okay? I'm trying to be *less* scared."
||aias_||Unfortunately it doesn't seem to Dante that there's any extra imperceivable depth to how Baeyo looks or what she's saying. Tragic.
||aias_||"Of course the system is unfair! It's always been unfair! That doesn't mean I'm just going to sit down and take it, I'll take whatever information I can get! Between the missing people, what's going on with the building, why *the chairman* is seemingly unaware of the things in and behind his own building..."

"And I need to hold somebody accountable for what happened with Akiko, I can't just let this get brushed over!"
Dante roll perception
||aias_||Baeyo matches his pace. She whips around to see Dante enter the scene. 

Perhaps he could offer her some relief but as she is now she can't afford to be distracted.
"Dante, I'm sorry, I'll spar later but I need to speak with Kazuo!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Excuse me, he says after the fact as he keeps walking. Look, if the building is unstable and people are missing- he keeps walking faster as Dante is now here too.
||aias_||(8) Kazuo just brushes her away as she's left there just pondering everything that had gone on in the last 2 days or so.
That doesn't stop her from turning around and walking beside him.

"The implications? Make it make sense then."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Str
||aias_||is that dex or str?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||(19) hehe
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Youre right there youre just not getting implications of it all, he tries pushing past her lemme roll.
||aias_||For all that it's worth, Baeyo is doing a fantastic job of maintaining her cool. Namely because as she mentioned before, she hasn't beat up her boss yet.

"..."

"*You're kidding*. You have multiple cameras in every room, you've blocked off all the exits, how could you possibly have lost track of more people?"

She runs her hands up through her hair, still looking a bit panicked and frenzied. 
"If you're so concerned about the integrity of the building, perhaps you should evacuate everyone outside right now before you guys get someone else killed."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Theres people missing? The building? He lists off.
||aias_||Baeyo sprints into the room and stands in his way.
"Kazuo we *need* to talk. What could possibly be more pressing than this right now?!"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> Kazuo is walking away, yarggh

||sadpastry||Thank *you.* I love you, Asami..! SNIIIIFFFF. She has to treat her hands before anything
||yaoiprincess||Asami `Composure: 10`

A tear rolls down her cheek but its quickly wiped away by her sleeve. Unfamiliar. 

Youre fine the way you are and knowing you were trying to protect me only gives me more determination to do better myself. Thank you, Callista. Really.

Asami smiles then bows again, deciding that continuing her speech will only end with her in tears. She starts making her way to rowdy room once more to give Callista some privacy.
||sadpastry||Ah, I *Asami* A similar situation, only she didnt immediately run away like Yuumi. No shade! She was just.. not in the room yet.

Im *sorry.* She chokes on another sob, the assumption being that she got better was incorrect. I am stubborn as well, the three of us are, but I I did not pause to consider your feelings. Both of you. I did not mean to to be cruel or scary, I just want you to be okay too. It hurts me to see you so upset, especially when I assumed I was protecting you. I now see I was.. I was wrong.

She steps a little closer, away from the wall, You are no coward, it is me. I should take better care of the few relationships I do have I am with you. I am *sorry.* This has been I *hate* today. It is terrible, and and I am no better, I am sorry. Even in her blubbering, she tries to stay strong! She sees Asami is struggling just as much as she is, if not doing a little better.. *(which is.. honestly a good thing if Callista is the worst one in the room, she thinks to herself.)*

I will do Ill be better! I will tell you the.. occurances later, and I shall be so much more than what I am! Just.. I just Perhaps fixing her gloved hands in a moment of solitude will be what helps right now, and then a debrief later. She hopes her damp, guilty gaze is enough to convey that plan to her.
||yaoiprincess||I apologize. Asami deeply sighs and allows her shoulders to slump. Callista, youre one of the only friends I have and unfortunately, the only woman I have a close relationship with. Ive tried not to pry into your affairs but watching you injured and manic has been scary for me.

Her posture straightens.

Ive never been scared of anything before. It wasnt until we became close that I started to fear everything. I dont know what I would do if you became gravely injured. Asami shakes her head and fixes her dress.

I would do anything for you but I refuse to risk losing you, theres a lot about this world I want to experience with you first.

I will not be ordered nor will I continue to allow myself to be insulted for the sake of ones feelings. *I am also stubborn, its my achilles heel* and my only regret is hurting you with that vice of mine. 

A deep bow, Asami chews on her cheek before spitting out the last of her feelings. `Composure: 9`

Perhaps Im a coward for not being more persistent in protecting what little I have. She quietly makes her way to the Rowdy Room.
||sadpastry||Oh, *Yuumi,* I Well, there was no point in stopping him, but she does call out and say, I love you very much..! Before he completely exits! Then she looks at Asami, sniffling. Your turn babygirl
||pulsatilla||"You're not naive, or stupid." He sighs, head shaking. This is all so tiring. "There are some things I will not let stand, this being one of them- you are by far... an important person in my life. A statement I would have not seen myself saying back when we first met, I am *tired* of seeing you this way- and- if I aid to this in any means I am sorry." 

He takes another step back, towards the lobby entrance. "I'm not going to allow someone to preach nonsense about me, or the situations we have gone through. There are *reasons* I am *stubborn*." He touches his forehead, where his hair is covering. 

"And I know you would do the same for me if this were swapped." His hand lowers, retreating to the maid dress he carries with him still. "We're both stubborn." Painfully so.

He walks back into the rowdy room, saying nothing else to Asami as he leaves.
||sadpastry||..Can you two *please* stop fighting? She chokes out. Tears have gone beyond welling in her eyes and are now making their way down her face.

As she lowers her head, she swipes her sleeves under her eyes. She was doing so well, abd yet

I do not know.. what to say right now. We are supposed to be friends, all of us. She coughs a little as she continues, And And I am an *adult* I know that I was not exposed to much, both of you are aware that that I am naive and *stupid*, but this does not help anyone. Both of you are my friends who have supported me through times of hardship, but this is just This is *ridiculous!*

She sniffs loudly, brows furrowed, I am tired. This has been one of the worst days of my life. I need *both of you* right now but, if you care *so desperately about me,* you would understand I do not want you two to bicker like children. I am going to treat my own hands now and calm down Both of you, just.. go back inside. Leave me be unless I go back inside or if someone is injured. She presses her back to the wall.
||yaoiprincess||Asami clicks her tongue again and plays with her newly braided hair.
||pulsatilla||He's not gonna reply, he just looks at Callista, waiting for her to say her peace.
||yaoiprincess||Scared of the truth? Asami is weirdly calm. The only one digging themselves deeper is you, Akiara and insulting me wont change that. I dont have issues with you but I have issues with your methods and my companions becoming hurt by your actions. If you care so much youd be there for Soraya as well.
||pulsatilla||If there were a camera right now, he'd be staring dead at it. 

"Yes, because I am the one hurting her the most right now. Since you know everything, and choose to speak for her, then you'd know that I am the last person to be driving her this way. But, alas, continue to run your mouth and dig yourself deeper. Reiterate the past forty-eight hours for her, and let's go step by step on how *I* am the one hurting her. How *I* use her for shortcomings when in reality, I have been there for her more than *some* people who have promised her her entire world only to crush it and humiliate her." He's growing frustrated, visibly so.

He lets her hand go, taking a step back. "If Callista wants to speak with you, then by all means that's *fine*. However, I will not be slandered by you when you merely have less than a fraction of knowledge of what she's been through. You weren't there, you haven't been there, so *sit down and don't speak as if you were.* I have *no* issues with you wanting to help, I only have *issues* with you making assumptions."
||yaoiprincess||Asami laughs. Do you believe Im intoxicated? No, I dont because she was too busy attending to you and your disasters and I wanted to respect her wishes. Deep breath. She has been getting hurt because of *you.* Because you use her to make up for your own shortcomings instead of handling it yourself. I am not standing around for that any longer.
||pulsatilla||"Do you even know what has happened to her within the past fourty-eight hours?" He stands straight. "Or are you too busy drinking? I don't think a person like you and your intoxication should be around her at the moment."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Damn its about the maid dress huh
||sadpastry||<:guh:1215925734640582666> she fucking ate him alive oh my god.
||yaoiprincess||I want to simply be here for Callista and Ive been nothing but patient with you. She clicks her tongue. Judging from how things have been, I think itd do her good to have me around more.
||sadpastry||Callista holds both of their hands with that soft, teary scowl.
||pulsatilla||They make it here before he stops dragging her.

He stops to look back at Asami. "What do you want?"

||snombi||<a:walkin:1058575685431603372>
||starzono||To the mall!!!!
Time to follow!!
||snombi||Were they really all that cool? They sometimes made her feel like an old lady.. Haha. Then again, she may as well be one, considering how frail she looked despite her young age. 

"Le.. Let's.. g..go into the.. m..mall.." She starts heading to the <#1212803669943124008>.
||starzono||Oh my!! Those are incredible hobbies!! How fun!! Ive always wanted to sew, never got a chance to learn. So wonderful!!!
He clapped a bit.

But, yes Let us work elsewhere!!
||snombi||At least he was. She felt nervous, like Valmont was going to turn tail and leave her when she didn't speak enough. Like somehow that was the worst possible thing to ask him. Now she wants to go elsewhere, since they probably came up short here. 

"Umm.. I.. I like.. s..sewing.. kn..knitting.. and.. and um.. I.. I recently.. pi.. picked up.. crocheting.." 

She looks further down the hall, then back to Valmont. "Wa..Want to.. ke.. keep going..?"
||starzono||That makes so much sense!! It is so fun that we dress like our favorite colors, how fun is that??? So fun!!
Nodnodnod.
What are your hobbies?? Or skills? Or both??
He is having fun :)
||snombi||She waves back at Yuling as he passes by.. She's a little nervous because she asked probably one of the most boring questions imaginable. 

"Aha.. th..that.. makes.. sense.. I.. I probably.. um.. sh..should've.. assumed.. that.." She sounds like she just committed a crime or something. "Um.. I.. I like.. p..purple.. and.. and black.." She murmurs.
||starzono||Oh!! Oh!! My favorite color? Probably red! Or teal!! I made that my brand~
He does a spin to reflect that. Yay!!
But!!! I love all colors. Like oranges and yellows!! And, glitter is often silver or gold but when reflected in light it can look like a rainbow!! So wonderful!!

What is your favorite color???
||snombi||"Ah, mnm.." She's trying to sort it all out in her head. What would Valmont even like to talk about..? Sure, he suggested stuff, but she's overthinking literally everything again. "..Wh..what's.. your.. f..favorite.. color.." 

she wants to die that was so lame
||starzono||We can talk about anything!! The basics, like favorite things, hobbies, what home is like, pets if you have any, so many options to talk about!! Maybe it will lead into talking about something else too!
||snombi||"I..I, um.. I.. I'm.. *Idontknowwhattotalkabout*." She said very quickly, and also even equally nervously. She was trying so hard.
||starzono||"Well, if you do want to talk, I am always happy to!!"
Jazz hands!!!
||snombi||"N..Nooo.." She almost whines, already embarrassed. She's going to crawl into a hole and die now. Except not really.
||starzono||...? He could hear that. He was so confused. Huh??
"Mademoiselle Soraya? Are, you saying something?"
||snombi||While they were searching around, Soraya tries to talk to Valmont again, but she's falling up short and struggling with things to talk about. So, what happens is that Soraya starts speaking, and it then devolves into some incoherent noises. She lowers her head and pretends she didn't even doing anything.
||starzono||Heck yeah, here they are!! Time to investigate as well. He's going to go ahead and check if there's any under the plaques, if they can be removed, that is <3

<@&1213006530828566598>
||snombi||She steps out into the hall again. She knows there's the screening room, but what catches her eyes was the storage closet. She wonders if she could get in there and look for cards, so she does just that, if she's even able to get in there. <@&1213006530828566598> 

<@272423756809371670>
||snombi||Wheee..
||starzono||Spinning on through 
||starzono||Through with Adiel 
||pulsatilla||He follows.
||sadpastry||Of course! Let us depart! She runs away!
||pulsatilla||"...Can we discuss this within your room?" He doesn't trust... being out in the open...
||sadpastry||Callista, pretty deflated, seems to naturally brighten up when Yuumi rolls with it! Oh! Um.. Well, I do not know. I was just told that it is wise taking it slow to mentally prepare being so vulnerable and intimate with a person. Have you ever thought about a thing like that?
||pulsatilla||"..." He glances up.,,. "What are the steps needed?" He doesn't think he'll follow them, but it wouldn't hurt to learn more about things.
||sadpastry||No, not an issue, but.. I do not know another word for it.
||pulsatilla||"I don't... think it is an issue..."
||sadpastry||Sure, but I think that while we are here we should address the issue at hand!
||sadpastry||Dms
||pulsatilla||"I don't think these are as important as the urge to escape is..." 
||pulsatilla||YUUMI LEANS IN.
||pulsatilla||WHO IS SHE TEXTING
||sadpastry||Yes, but I believe these internal conflicts are equally as important. I want to help you. She also whips out the device.
||pulsatilla||"..." He lowers the phone, sighing. "I am unsure, shouldn't we be focusing on finding ways out of here instead?"
||sadpastry||Well, are you ready for those steps?
||pulsatilla||He looks down at his phone, back to texting.
||pulsatilla||"Self reflection?"
||sadpastry||shes winning. That is okay! I have not either. My first kiss was Dante.  We can figure out the answer through conversation and time. Perhaps self reflection too? :D

||yaoiprincess||Asami follows
||elainatime||through
||yaoiprincess||Into the room
||elainatime||12
||elainatime||Xavier is peaking his head out of the rowdy room to watch this. (stealth: 13)
||elainatime||Xavier pretends not to hear this, but you notice that his hands clench briefly into fists before relaxing again.
||elainatime||roll perception :]]
||elainatime||Xavier coldly pushes Aspen back against the wall with his free hand, its harder than youd expect it to be (str:13). He whips around and walks up to Thomas, grabbing him by the shoulders and leading him into the Rowdy Room. You heard the man! Lets go!
||elainatime||Xavier cups aspens face gently with one hand. Itll make me the *happiest man on the planet*. He smiles lovingly, but it doesnt reach his eyes.
||elainatime||*Yeah!* Hes whispering oh so sweetly. He brushes the hair out of Aspens face. A game! A fun game! With you, and me, and everyone else! He brings his face very close to Aspens, and barely above a breath: *Its gonna be so fun.*
||elainatime||Doesnt it sound fun, Aspen? To play a little game? With all your *friends*? Xaviers very close to Aspen now, inches away.
||elainatime||Aspen! Xavier approaches Aspen sweetly. Hes ignoring Junzo. Dont you want to play a game, Aspen?
||elainatime||. Xavier approaches Junzo. His volume is much lower now. Every word is pronounced. What the fuck are you talking about? Im calm, Junzo. Im *calm as fuck*. Cant you see that? He takes a step back, opening himself up to the rest of the group. I just want to play a little game. With all of my friends. Because thats what we all are, right? Friends.
||elainatime||*What?*
||elainatime||Aspen?? Xavier imitates Aspen sarcastically. Yeah, and Junzo, and Yuling.
||elainatime||Thomas. Xaviers here and has some weird energy in him. Do you know how to play rage cage?
||yaoiprincess||Passes
||pulsatilla||Walk,
||elainatime||Xavier through, drink in hand.
||starzono||Walking walking
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Cards in this area none
||pulsatilla||<a:haiiiii:1211397316423188582>
||yaoiprincess||She waves! Sorry!
||elainatime||Xavier is following behind.
||yaoiprincess|| She stands here because she forgot Xavier.
||yaoiprincess||Asami will let go of the paintings and keep walking then!
||yaoiprincess||((OOOOOH OKAY))
||elainatime||((I think that probably means nothing here))
||elainatime||Xavier in, watching Asami look for cards. He sighs hard and then looks in the storage closet. <@&1213006530828566598> ((is anything in there?))
||yaoiprincess||She stops here for a moment and looks around the floor and behind the painting any cards? <@&1213006530828566598>
||elainatime||through
||elainatime||through
||elainatime||Xavier trails behind, silently.
||elainatime||Xavier registers this, and connects some dots in his brain. It seems like the sparkles drain out of his eyes. .Lets just go.
||elainatime||"Do you want to get.... Jamba Juice?"
||elainatime||"......."
||elainatime||"....Yes."
||elainatime||Xavier walks right up to Aspen. He looks him in the eyes, puts his hand on his shoulder, and says: " Um. Do you know? What a pretzel? Is?" ((9/100))
||sadpastry||Goodbye! She RUNS.
||elainatime||"Oh- bye Callista! See you soon!" Xavier waves.
||sadpastry||Callista opens her mouth to say something, but she looks at Xavier, then back to Aspen 

No!!! No, I am going to rest. I am quite tired after a lot of.. um, standing. Xavier, you are *charming* and *lovely.* Never forget that. And Aspen, if I can lend a listening ear about your minor spat with him, then do let me or Xavier know. I care for you! So does he!
||elainatime||The light is draining from Xaviers eyes. Um, wh? Oh. Yeah! sure. Hes trying to remember how to drop his Jamba Juice Giftcards.
||sadpastry||Callistas demeanor eases when he ruffles her hair, That is good to hear! Um.. And earlier, I noticed you and Mister Junzos glances in the hallway. After the sleepover? I am not sure though, Im sorry if Im assuming incorrectly.
||sadpastry||Who is it..? I suppose I have a guess, but.. I just wanted to check in since it seems youre occupied even now. I hope that they arent giving you too much trouble. She sways from side to side. Anxious.
||elainatime||Hes standing there. Not coming in yet.
||elainatime||
||elainatime||Xavier is mustering up some courage.
||sadpastry||//FAIR ILY

That seems to be the case with many. I hope you find cards soon, darling!

And then.. she squints a little. Its only silent for a minute before she speaks again, I hate to pry, but.. Is something bothering you, Aspen? Or perhaps someone?
||starzono||Skipping on through!!!!!
||helminthic||Thru with Valmont....
||sadpastry||I am also quite well! We are doing good. Have you obtained cards since we last spoke? 
||sadpastry||Correct. And he will text if necessary! It shall be fine.. She smiles weakly hah yeahhh How are you?
||sadpastry||I think it is funny we always find ourselves in these situations! Haha.
||sadpastry||.I hope not. Dante is a tough guy, though. I believe he will be okay. Shes also very worried.
||sadpastry||I.. I do not know. I am slightly scared, if I am entirely honest. 
||sadpastry||She slowly turns to Aspen and just. <:c_standingcat:1116502496127492157>
||sadpastry||Aki?? As in Aki from the phone?? I *UM* She holds out a hand but since Akikos already gone, then shes not chasing.
||sadpastry||Callista.. will look at Aspen, then back at the scene and call out! Um!! Please wait!! Who are you? What are you lifting??
||sadpastry||She leans into Aspens hand.. Maybe things will be well? ^U^

Oh. Wait. Perchance not. Oh! Um! Okay?
||sadpastry||I support you, Dante. SHE LOOKS AT ASPEN. SIGH.
||sadpastry|| Smooch babes before you punch walls. Your hand is one punch away from being shattered.
||sadpastry||If you say you are good, then I shall trust that. Yet the offer still stands! I adore you, Dante, and I shall be here for you until the end of time! In smooches and all! She shrugs weakly, Yuumis word, as scary as he is, is not absolute. You are an adult man capable of making choices with your own free will.
||sadpastry|| Professionally, I am only a *teeeeensy* worried about your coping mechanisms in relation to your stress and overwhelming emotions. Friend wise, I just want you to know I support you through anything and am here if you ever need aid, a listener, a distraction Anything!
||sadpastry||Do you want my professional opinion or my friend opinion?
||sadpastry||[7]
||yaoiprincess||Yooo wtf where did Asami come from with her perception roll
||elainatime||Xavier keeps looking at Dante.
||elainatime||Oh, I, honestly I like have those, like all the time. Like Im kind of always like in one of those.
||elainatime||Oh, yeah. Um. Dante, are you okay?
||elainatime||Wait, is that a nintendo DS? Xavier has mistaken Aspens device for a nintendo DS.
||elainatime||tell me. tell me. what does xavier see.
||elainatime||(-1)
||elainatime||Hey Aspen! Xavier is waving. He glances at Dante.
||elainatime||Xavier turns around (very quietly). And then turns around again! Wha-? Oh, Hey Aspen! I like, totally didnt like, notice you came in!
||sadpastry||SIGH OF RELIEF. Hello, Aspen! She waves!!!!!!
||elainatime||
||sadpastry||Her hands go behind her back.
||sadpastry||Mmn.. No, it is okay. Weak smile.
||sadpastry||.I She frowns a little bit, holding up her gloved hands. I can not allow that, I am sorry.
||elainatime||Xavier does it with Dantes finger and his own thumb. Finger - Removed. Robot voice.
||sadpastry||Woww.. The fact that he isnt freaking out really means this *is* magic.

..THAT IS POSSIBLE?
||elainatime||Xavier does it again. Finger - Removal - Service. Robot voice.
||sadpastry||SNE SNIFFLES. OKAY GOOD. THAT WAS VERY NICE IF YOU ARE NOT HURT.
||elainatime||Magic trick. Hes doing a robot voice.
||sadpastry||How did you?! IS YOUR THUMB OKAY? I do not have materials for stitches!!
||sadpastry||# WHAT ON EARTH.
||elainatime||Wait wait wait. He robot comes up to Callista. Watch this! He does that little finger trick where you pretend to slide your thumb off of the tip of your other finger.
||sadpastry||No, it is okay to not say it back. I am sorry.. She robot slides away from Xavier.
||elainatime||Xavier sees her eyes filling with tears. Um. I mean. Um. I love you too Callista!
||sadpastry||..*What?* Her eyes well with tears.
||elainatime||This is getting kind of weird
||sadpastry||I love you, Dante! I love you, Xavier!
||sadpastry||=] She robot spins.
||elainatime||I love you too Callista!
||sadpastry||Xavier, I love you too.
||elainatime||I love you too Dante!
||sadpastry||I love you too!
||sadpastry||Callista twitches like shes short circuiting.
||elainatime||Xavier also does the robot Haha, awesome
||sadpastry||She starts to do the robot.
||sadpastry||I do not know!
||sadpastry||She twirls.
||bellboy||LOVED THIS
||bellboy||YALL GOT THE SILLY OR SMTH
||sadpastry||Thank you, Dante!! She pats his unconscious head a few times.
||sadpastry||Callista CHEERS. Now do you see what must be done? Was that an adequate example??? :3
||elainatime||~Oh you!!- He laughs gracefully. You are, um, you do. Your! Well. I have? I have to go! My mom is- my ? I have?? Goodbye. Xavier does a spin out of character.
||sadpastry||I would not leave like that, for the record.
||sadpastry||Callista claps.
||pulsatilla||GONE.
||pulsatilla||YUUMI IS LEAVING.
||sadpastry||https://tenor.com/view/mewing-gif-11339234860235694668
||pulsatilla||HE LOOKS AT DANTE.
||sadpastry||Wow, you do your own. She pauses. pursing her lips. staring..

..*stunts?* Her brows waggle, Oh, *ASPEN,* you never cease to amaze me! You are radiant, like the sun. I only hope that you feel similarly.. about *meeeee..* Because I am so cute and amazing and charming!
||elainatime||"~Xavier!!~ You are so!! I , when you play guitar!! Tell me, Well! I do my own Stunts! MERDE!" He beams.
||sadpastry||YES. BE CALLISTA!!
||sadpastry||Hello, *ASPEN.* I am Xavier, as you know! You are so sparkly. She bats her eyelashes.
||elainatime||"Wait - so this means, um Yuumi, you should be, like Callista."
||pulsatilla||"What??"
||sadpastry||AHEM.
||sadpastry||Okay sure!
||elainatime||"Oh, wait, do you need someone to pretend to be Aspen? Here." He squares his chest and smiles. "~HHi!~ I'm AspEn!"
||sadpastry||I was hoping you knew.
||sadpastry||No, no, just.. Here! Let me show you! AHEM. Im *Xaaaavierrr,* and I am *so* charming and handsome and brilliant and talented! Her voice gets an octave higher.
||pulsatilla||"What even is Jamba Juice?"
||elainatime||"Um, but how do I, like, pretend to drop my personality?"
||sadpastry||Why do you need Jamba Juice cards? Just flex your brilliant personality instead!!
||elainatime||Xavier fist bumps Dante. Thanks, yeah, Ill um. Have to get some Jamba Juice Giftcards.
||elainatime||Y-? Really? Xavier thought they were out of character already. You thought that was good?
||elainatime||Oh-okay
||elainatime||Um, isnt that like, the Public Broadcasting Service?
||elainatime||Like, right now?
||elainatime||Um! Okay!
||elainatime||Oh, you did? What was that, um? Did, is that where, like, is that where they told you about pretzels?
||elainatime||Oh. Xavier inhales. Its like, um. Um. Like, Its bread. Xavier exhales. Um. Xavier inhales again. But its in. Xavier exhales. A weird shape? Xavier inhales. And its from, like, Germany. Xavier exhales the rest of the breath out of his lungs and then does one nod, with finality.
||elainatime||Um. Aspen?
||elainatime||.. Um, do you like, do ? Um. Do you know? What a pretzel? Is? ((9/100))
||elainatime||Okay. Xavier clears his throat. Um.
||elainatime||Dude, no, I dont think, I mean. Xaviers confidence is shot.
||elainatime||
||elainatime||Xavier deflates and looks at Dante.
||pulsatilla||"Not really."
||elainatime||to um to go, um to , the , to go, and , to get, to um , to !? to dinner.
||elainatime||Xavier is getting pumped with Dantes encouragement. Because you want it!!!! And theres money! In the ! My ! I because !! The cash!! He removes his hand from Yuumis shoulder. Do you want to go, to go, to go, to go, um, to go, um
||pulsatilla||"Why are you touching me?"
||elainatime||Do you? Like? Jamba Juice?
||elainatime||Xavier does blue steel again and then walks up to Yuumi. Um, Like, Hello Aspen. He smiles and sets one hand on Yuumis shoulder.
||elainatime||Wait! wait.
||pulsatilla||"Are we done yet?"
||pulsatilla||"..."
||elainatime||Xavier takes a deep breath and then does the Blue Steel face to Yuumi.
||elainatime||Wait, wait. Okay, okay, Wait.  I think? Okay, let me try.
||pulsatilla||"Okay."
||pulsatilla||"..."
||elainatime||Jamba Juice? I dunno, Dante, I feel like, you know, those smoothies are like, theyre, okay yeah theyre overpriced, but theyre not like, expensive? I guess?
||elainatime||Oh yeah. He goes to pick it up, and then realizes that theres not actually anything there.  He glances at Yuumi, confused, and then directs his attention back to Dante.
||pulsatilla||"You should pick that up." He points at the nonexistent gift cards.
||elainatime||Ohhh, *ohhh*! He gets it. But, wait, shouldnt I just, like, drop cash? To show that I got cash?
||elainatime||Oh, okay, okay. Xavier pretends to drop a bunch of Jamba Juice giftcards. Ah! Oh! I dropped, like, I dropped all my Jamba Juice giftcards! He crouches on the ground. Um, are you like, um. Is it? Do you? Wait. He stands up again. Do you think I should also pretend to drop a Jamba Juice Smoothie? Or just the giftcards.
||elainatime||Ohhh, okay. Xavier pretends to drop something. Wait, Dante, I dont have any Jamba Juice giftcards.
||pulsatilla||"..."
||elainatime||Oh! Um. Yeah! Cool.
||pulsatilla||"Good." Like a brick wall...
||elainatime||Um. He walks up to Yuumi. .hhHey! Um. Aspen. Um. How? Hows it? Going? Um.
||pulsatilla||"My name is Aspen." Oh no, he's committed to the bit.
||elainatime||I dont I dont know if I can, like, um. Rizz? up? Yuumi?
||elainatime||Um. He looks back at Dante.
||elainatime||Xavier is fidgeting with his hands.
||elainatime||
||pulsatilla||
||elainatime||
||elainatime||Um, okay He turns to Yuumi.
||elainatime||Yeahhhh, yeah, but.
||elainatime||I dont. Xavier takes a good look at Yuumi. I dont think. Um. I just, like, Im not sure how this would help?
||elainatime||Um. I dunno, um, if this, like, if. Um.
||pulsatilla||"...." He sighs. "Fine."
||elainatime||Um.
||pulsatilla||"Why would I do that?"
||pulsatilla||
||sadpastry||Callista blushes and twirls her hair at the mention of her + butterflies. Having a nickname makes her feel so special!

Oh!! What a good idea! Yuumi, you should definitely aid Xavier, yes yes! Please?
||elainatime||Um. Xavier closes his eyes and thinks. Oh hes thinking. Hes thinking hard. Um. Aspen. Um. Yes! Gears turning in that skull. Sparkles! Actor! Oh dude those braincells are starting to warm up, if you listen closely you can hear popcorn popping. France! Its like a tea kettle starts to whistle. Butterflies!!! OH!!! Engine popping and sputtering out noise. Oh god, hes working himself too hard. Um um um um. Hes trying to think but no more words are coming. That was a great effort though.
||elainatime||Dude, are you okay? Xavier is genuinely concerned.
||elainatime||if theyre good xavier will sing along
||elainatime||wait wait u should roll to see how good the guitar noises are
||elainatime||What? No! No, no, its not, like, I mean. I mean, like I just, like I just met him! I just, I dont know, I think, like, maybe its like.? I dont know.
||sadpastry||
||sadpastry||You and Aspen were very cute in my room. Do not worry, he did not catch what Asami was saying! Your secret is safe!!! Nod, nod.
||elainatime||Okay. Thank you. Xavier recoils, taking a few steps away and putting his hands behind his head.
||pulsatilla||"I texted Baeyo because she texted me first." He scrunches up his face. "It was not about you and Aspen."
||elainatime||What? Xavier watches Yuumi send a message, then glances at Dante. He knits his eyebrows together, then approaches Yuumi. Dude, are you ?-  Okay, look, Im sorry if this is like, making assumptions, but like, what did you -? like, on your phone. Thats not like, about whats happening, right?
||pulsatilla||"You are the one keeping me here." He snaps his own eyes at Dante.
||pulsatilla||"The whole point of me saying I'm not interested relates to me not going to tell people, stop talking to me about this." He then looks at his phone, scowling. He taps it and then pockets it.
||elainatime||
Thats not, like, what Im saying though. Like I get its not like, important to you, but Im saying its important to me. So like, Im just asking if you could please, like, actually not share that with other people.
||pulsatilla||"I just said I have no interest in your love life." He squints.

"I have far more important things to worry about than you playing footsies with Aspen."
||elainatime||No, like seriously. I, like, would really like this to be like. Hes spinning his index fingers around each other. Like, just between us. Like, not, spread around or anything. You know?
||pulsatilla||"I am not interested in your love life."
||elainatime||Um, Yuumi? He turns towards peepaw. You, like, did you like, um? How much of that did you hear?
||pulsatilla||"Put me down,"
||elainatime||No, no. I think, like, I mean, I dont really think he like, *likes* me like that. And like, even if he did, I think I wouldnt want it to be, like, um, like orchestrated? Or like, manufactured? Like, I would want it to be like natural and everything. Like, come about naturally. You know?
||pulsatilla||<:bun_yuck:1074226076844314674>
||elainatime||Oh- Dude! Xaviers face is red. I mean, you dont think, I mean, maybe its like, I mean. Its probably, like, I. Like, Um. Its not, Um, *like* that, you know? Like, we dont, like we cant really know anything.
||sadpastry||thank god
||elainatime||((perception: 3)) Xavier is completely unaware of anything happening in the room outside of his conversation with Dante
||sadpastry||WHISTLES.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi is walking away.
||pulsatilla||
||elainatime||Okay. Well you know how, we were like, in Callistas bed together? Well, we were literally laying there, and we were both like, sleeping! Except honestly I wasnt sleeping because I was like, oh my god Aspen is literally right in bed behind me right now? And I didnt want to like flip over towards him because what if he was like awake and had his eyes open, I have no idea what I would have done. So I just, like, pretended to be asleep. And then maybe he like, scooted closer or something? But I also, like, really subtly, I like moved like an inch closer to him and then literally we were asleep, well he was asleep, and I literally like my foot was touching his leg like we were literally TOUCHING. While we- while he was asleep. And I was also, like, asleep for part of it I think. Like while we were touching. But like, I dont know if that, like, means anything.
||sadpastry||CALLISTA INTENTIONALLY LOOKS AWAY.
||elainatime||Okay, well, he puts his hand on Dantes shoulder. You, like, actually seriously cannot tell anyone about this. Like, seriously, this stays between you and me. Like I know you like, sometimes you like to share and stuff, but I need you to like actually promise 100% that you really wont tell anyone about this, okay?
||elainatime||Xavier is still giggling intermittently. He goes up to Dante and lightly pokes his foot into Dantes side. Wait, do you wanna, like, hear about what happened with Aspen? I dont think Yuumi or Callista are like paying attention or anything.
||elainatime||Xavier comes back in. Dude, Im not gonna lie, I like literally almost peed my pants back there. Like it was a close one. I was like, I literally had like, 30 seconds.
||elainatime||Xavier runs to the bathroom, still howling with laughter as he goes.
||elainatime||Xavier is crying. Dude, stop- dude stop Im gonna pee my pants-
||elainatime||Dude! Oh my god, Bro, dude, stop, I literally - I *know* you know what youre doing! It takes Xavier about 45 seconds to get that sentence out. He cant look at Dante without doubling over with laughter.
||elainatime||Xavier is full on laughing now. Dante! No, dude, I know youre like, obviously doing that, like youre- He has to keep taking pauses between words to laugh.
||elainatime||Xavier is giggling harder. No! Dude youre doing it on purpose now!!
||elainatime||Xavier giggles. Dont, like, blink at me like that man.
||elainatime||Wait, he *Paid* you??
||elainatime||Xavier is blinking at Dante. Are you, like, being, like, for real right now? Like youre not like just fucking with me?
||elainatime||Wait. Wait. *Wait.* Xavier is thrusting his hands out in front of him and shaking his head, squeezing his eyes shut. He lifts up both arms and presses the backs of his hands into his eyes, leaning his head back as he does. Then, he squares his arms and chops both hands down towards Dante: *What?* He stares at Dante for a moment before pressing his left hand to the bridge of his nose and putting his right hand on Dantes shoulder. Dude, Im sorry, I- You- Dude, can you like, how did that happen??
||elainatime||Xavier is nodding along. Yeah, no he sucks. Um, wait though, did you say you hooked up with *Elon Musk?*
||elainatime||Oh. Xavier deflates for a fraction of a second, and then smiles guiltily. Well, it definitely wasnt important if I cant remember like, why I was even saying it. Um. - Did you win your pinball, at least?
||elainatime||No, that was actually crazy though. like honestly that was actually super weird. Like, I would literally go to the, like, to pick up food with him for like, events that we would do  he was like, I had to work with him sometimes for college stuff. And like the people like scanning his food and making him pay and stuff - oh my god, wait why did I say it like that?? I sound like they were gonna beat him up. Theyre gonna *make him pay* Xavier laughs, leaning forward. Then, Anyways. The grocery store people were always like so fucking confused. Like they would watch him put his hand over it and be like Sir, that, like, you need a card for that- and it would just go through. And then he would do this like really dumb entitled smile, like, as if he was gonna be like, um actually and like teach them how to do their job, but he never actually said anything. Sorry, that was kind of mean. Xavier looks blankly straight in front of him for about 10 seconds and then turns to Dante. Do you remember, like, why I started talking about this?
||elainatime||Wait- wait, also, like you dont have a wallet, like here? Or do you just not have a wallet? Cause I feel like, like, most people are sort of like moving towards like having online everything? And like keeping it in like your iphone apple wallet or whatever? But also like I knew this guy once who literally had like a microchip in his hand. And it like literally had like his phone number and his credit card in it, so when he would like, check out at stores, he would like, put his hand on the scanner?? It was like, *Boop* He mimes putting the back of his hand against a credit card scanner. And he like, didnt have a wallet either, and he was always talking about it. It like, kind of, like no shade to him but it honestly kind of made me feel kind of annoyed after a while. And he was also, like weird for a lot of other reasons. And like also just not really super nice if Im being honest.
||elainatime||Wait, bro, what if like, we did like, my face in your locket, and then like, your face in my locket, and then we like, switched lockets? and then we would like both have a locket with our own face in it. Do you think that, like, would be like, a good idea?
||elainatime||Dude I would totally, like keep a picture of you in my wallet. And then I would be like, This is my friend Dante! And theyd be like, Woah, why is your friend so hot?? And itll be awesome. Wait, we should like, totally do this. Do you have like a photo of yourself that I could put in my wallet? like a printed out photo?
||elainatime||Oh, um, like, pretty good sometimes? But also, sometimes, like not really so good? Its kind of, like, complicated. But hes like, from like, Venezuela and you know how immigrant parents can be sometimes. But like, it totally makes sense. Like, I definitely get it. And he like worked really hard and everything, so like. Im like super grateful, but also sometimes there were times where I was like, kind of felt like, I dont know, like it was kind of not the greatest. Um. What about, like, you and your dad?
||elainatime||Oh my god, wow, I didnt even know you like had a tootsie pop center!! I thought it was all, like, organs in there and shit. Meat and bones! Meaty boney bean boy! (he says it like meatyboneybeanboy really hitting the bs. i have a specific delivery in mind but i cant explain it id just have to do it for you)
||elainatime||Xavier nods. Yeah. Yeah. Permanent marker is pretty cool. I could like, definitely see how you would be that one.
||elainatime||Oh, what dude, thats like, so nice, thank you so much.
||elainatime||Okay wait bro if you were like, any font, then what font would you be?? I think Id be Wingdings! He really ennunciates wingdings, it sounds like a-Win-guh-dings
||elainatime||Hes dante! Hes who you want-e! not a joke font-e! the elephant-e! oh yes hes dante! Xavier chants.
||elainatime||YOOOOOOOO!! DANTE!! Dude! You didnt tell me that you were like, fucking, so awesome at that!! Holy shit dude, that was fucking amazing!! Like literally how did you even think of that? That was so sick bro. That was like, dude, like we gotta write that down!!!
||elainatime||Xaviers beatboxing is fucking awesome (19). Dante, you gotta freestyle on this shit man!
||elainatime||Xavier starts beatboxing
||elainatime||Oh. Yeah. I dont think I know him.
||elainatime||Oh, shit, okay, can he like, understand english then? Or like
Also, what was the name of the other person you said? I dont know if I know them.
||elainatime||Was he the one was doing, um, like FSL?
||elainatime||Yeah! Yeah thats what it was. He laughs at himself.
||elainatime||Oh, who? Was that the, um, the guy who was doing, like, um, like, um, wait this is gonna sound so stupid I promise I just cant remember what its called I know this isnt what it is but he was doing like gang signs in french?
||elainatime||oh, what? Really? Wow. I feel like Ive, like, seen everyone at this point.
||pulsatilla||"....I... Guess..." <:uhhhh:1152089782957121577>
||pulsatilla||"Theoretical question. Such as if the statement was used by someone else, but they did not like hotdogs. Could they replace it with one of their interests?"
||elainatime||Wait, and havent they like, been talking and shit? Like, why would she like, wait until right now to punch her? Thats kind of weird I feel.
||pulsatilla||"...Could you replace the hotdog with other interests?" He's trying to get to the bottom of this.
||elainatime||Wait, Wait, she burned down Baeyos *House??* Thats CRAZY! Like, do you know, like, how??? Or like, why? She did that?
||pulsatilla||"What???"
||pulsatilla||
||elainatime||<:xaviergasp:1214852666040127489>
||pulsatilla||"Mackin' hotdog style."
||elainatime||wait, *what?* Shes a *terrorist??* Xavier looks pale
||pulsatilla||"What does that mean?"
||elainatime||Oh! Dante, by the way, what like, happened last night with Baeyo? I kinda like missed it?
||elainatime||<@&1213006530828566598> Xavier is looking at the backsides of all the paintings
||sadpastry||She is joyous.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi just stands there, he will follow the group wherever. Penelope gives back kissy noises but they sound more like smnwejkwnswmnekwnksn I don't know what rats sound like other than sqwueak.
||elainatime||oldmaidcoded
||sadpastry||Callista makes kissy noises for Penelope.
||elainatime||Xavier nods. Yeah. Yeah. Cardpilled.
||sadpastry||Callista saw Xavier and Aspen in her room, but she.. will keep that for now. I wish you luck, Xavier. Nod.
||pulsatilla||<a:SCwet:773951662318551121>
||elainatime||Wait, no come back Yuumi! Nothing, like, theres not even like anything to talk about.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi lets out a huff, and starts walking away.
||elainatime||Um I dont know if I should, like, talk about it with, like, um, um, like, um, like, present, like, present, like company, like um the people- like I just wouldnt want like the wrong thing getting spread around or anything. He looks nervously towards Yuumi.
||elainatime||Xavier tries to spin gracefully like a ballerina.
||sadpastry||We shall play when we find the both of you cards then! I have five already. 
||elainatime||He takes the high fives in earnest.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi stares at Xavier.
||elainatime||Dante!! Xavier throws his arms up. Dr. Inferno!!
||elainatime||Oh, cards? Xavier walks forward. I have one pair but then the rest of my cards got, like, taken by other people I wouldnt say that I like super get how the game works, but it seemed like maybe I should be like finding more cards or something? So I was gonna try to do that but then I havent found any, so. Um. I dont think weve traded yet.
||sadpastry||Hello! We are looking for cards. Her eyes gleam. Have we played with eachother yet?
||elainatime||Xavier in. Oh, hey guys. Whats up?
||pulsatilla||"I haven't looked through many of the mall areas, I've only checked the lobby and... That place." He points to the screening mall.
||pulsatilla||"Oh, I will wait then until we find more." He nods.
||sadpastry||Finally, she smiles again, albeit weakly. No, no, I only have two pairs. Youve been doing much better than I have.
||sadpastry||Callista just purses her lips and nods. If you say so.
||pulsatilla||"I'm fine." He looks back up to him. "Trade?" Cards out...
||pulsatilla||Yuumi won't talk about Dante's fragile masculinity. Instead, he focuses his attention to Penelope- who's enjoying the attention and pets, she's sqwueaking!
||sadpastry||She pauses to think. Mm.. It should take six to eight weeks or so, but given youve rebroken it, closer to eight. A hand surgery to correct another break would take closer to *months.* I do not want to see you in such a position, especially when I cant provide much help due to a lack of supplies. So.. instead of punching walls, you can talk to your friends.
||sadpastry||Callista pets Penelope gently.
||pulsatilla||She beckons Callista over with her tail, pet her.
||pulsatilla||... "How about we go see Kali when he is awake, I will need your assistance when figuring out the room issue. After, you and Callista can go see Mary Anne and introduce yourselves to her.'
||sadpastry||GASP. She wiggles a gloved finger towards her.
||sadpastry||Callista nods affirmingly, Recovery is even worse, and longer than it would be for normal fractures.
||pulsatilla||"She is here." 

<:yuumi:1059194969446944918> She pops out of Yuumi's hair, hiiiiii.
||pulsatilla||  "I have things I need to do, ask Callista."
||sadpastry||May I pet her when she is here?
||sadpastry||It will not if you keep punching walls. Your hands bones are so delicate If you continue to break and shatter your hand, you will need surgery.
||pulsatilla||"You're overthinking it."
||pulsatilla||"She is my daughter, yes."
||pulsatilla||"You don't need a rat to see the daycare." Squint.
||sadpastry||..Just please dont punch things that will hurt you back. Im very worried about your hand.

Then she turns to Yuumi. Slowly. . Is Penelope your rat?
||pulsatilla||"Then go see her for the rat daycare." He's gonna trick his ass into getting therapy.
||pulsatilla||"Mary Anne is a counselor of sorts, she's located on the 7th floor and also has a rat daycare which Penelope goes to." Huff!

"She is a very nice lady, and has recently helped me through a... moment. I want you to discuss your issues with her, and find a new way of venting that doesn't involve you hurting yourself or the wall."
||sadpastry||She looks at Yuumi because she has no idea.
||sadpastry||Callista merely nods in response. She decides to keep her hopes and wishes for how the punishments roll out to herself, especially since, You have a fair point.. I am sorry.

She takes a moment to look at Dante, frowning deeper. Just be careful no matter what you choose to do. Your hand is quite mangled as is, so maybe just.. direct your anger on softer things next time. Or perhaps Mary Anne will help if you go! And.. we are here to listen too. You have many options.
||pulsatilla||"You will go have a discussion with Mary Anne later." He looks back at him.
||pulsatilla||"I know what you mean." He looks at her, standing straight.

"But, unfortunately, Dante was with you when you were caught. He was still an accomplice to the crime, he was still lying and trying to gaslight. Therefore, he still deserves his portions of consequences. And I'm sure he knows that too, as he would have not have assisted if he didn't want that in the first place." He pushes his glasses up. It's unbelievably easy to pin the trouble onto someone else just by staying silent...
||sadpastry||Yuumi, I understand, I *do*, but I really to mean it when I say Dante was not Callista suddenly presses her lips together into a thin line, with her brows furrowed and eyes slightly glassy.

Then she looks down, holding her hands infront of her apron. Shame. *Yes sir.*
||pulsatilla||"I have a plan for your room damage, but you *need* to find better ways of out letting your emotions *than to the wall*." He huffs.

"Don't do anything to your room until I can speak to Kali, please."

He rubs his forehead, headache. . .

"Your apologies are forgiven, though I do expect both of you to do better from here on out."
||pulsatilla||"Callista, it's important to stop shouldering all the blame. Acknowledge your mistakes, but also recognize the contributions of others. Giving credit where it's due can make a significant difference, and you don't want to bear the consequences alone for the actions of two."

Taking a step back, he loosens his grip on them both. "I'm disappointed, yet relieved that neither of you received the same punishment as Junzo. Or anything close to that."

"And, next time, if my assistance is required- at least tell me what's going on before I throw myself in the mix." <@901984511892553739> <@220287412230815744>
||sadpastry||She just. decides to take the spray, eyes squeezing shut momentarily. On Yuumis command, Callista stops talking, bottom lip quivering.
||pulsatilla||He sprays them both with water. `11` He then clasps his hand to Dante's exposed cheek, and Callista's exposed cheek. 

"Enough."
||sadpastry||But I stole it! You just tried to help me cover my tracks when my time ran out!
||sadpastry||It was not even Dantes fault! The blame lies on my shoulders. Yuumi, I am truly sorry You will not face such a disappointment again, I promise. <:awwww:1158234237296709684>
||pulsatilla||"Are you now?"

"Then where is my apology?"
||sadpastry||*Smush.*

Mhmm We are very sorry and she accepted our apology.
||pulsatilla||He slowly, pushes Dante's head to be smushed against Callista's. Cheek to cheek. "Did Miss Rhea discuss your wrongdoings with you?"
||sadpastry||She leans in, cringing already.
||pulsatilla||He gestures for Callista and Dante to crouch to his level. <@220287412230815744>
||helminthic||Uno also waves to the others, making a white woman face as he did. He is off.
||starzono||More walking with Uno  
He did wave to the fellas here but he cannot stay, he's a man on a mission after all.
||sadpastry||Heelloooooo
||sadpastry||<:thingy:1036764144390656121>
||pulsatilla||
||sadpastry||oop
||sadpastry||You shall be okay, Dante. It was not your plan nor responsibility, and Yuumi will see that.
||pulsatilla||Step, step... He is here.
||sadpastry||Callista looks to Dante and frowns. I suppose he was bound to catch up with us eventually. SIIIIGH.
||sadpastry||<@&1213006530828566598> Callista first checks the art and plaques along the walls! Lifting them off the walls if she can to check behind the paintings/signs, and maybe even along the edges of the art frames in case something is tucked in there?
||sadpastry||HUZZAH
||elainatime||through
||sadpastry||THEYRE MACKING IT. YUP. THEY START GOING THROUGH THE LOBBY.
||yaoiprincess||She seems extremely annoyed! She continues walking.
||yaoiprincess||Asami walks by

||sadpastry||. . .
||sadpastry||Callista is here too.. batting her eyelashes

How is Baeyo checking the wall art exactly?
||aias_||<@&1213006530828566598> Baeyo's checking her beloved gate, and the wall art and the plaques to see if there are any cards lodged between them and the wall.

And walks though the now opened gate.

She's erm...eto...*bleh*'ing in her head

||elainatime||Xavier shuffles through, following the crowd.
||aias_||Baeyo glances at Junzo
||frooztiez||Theri dislikes going anywhere else in this building... she's slowly re-entering her hoodie.
||starzono||"See, nothing to be concerned about!! Simple wall noises!!"
Time to go to the mall baby WOO
||pulsatilla||"I won't." He wheels away.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``Then suddenly, without further warning, the white metal gate raises to showcase the`` <#1212803669943124008> 
<@&1012808089424105614>
||elainatime||Xavier slips out from under Dante and stands back up.
||starzono||"It's only concerning if it is something to be concerned about!! It's probably just, wall noises. Perhaps."
||yaoiprincess||We are talking about Dantes vaginal organ at the moment.
||pulsatilla||"All 403 of them? Yes. Don't do that again."
||helminthic||"Concerning sounds from the walls, right, everyone?..." Uno asks... almost as a joke... these people are soo...... weird.
||snombi||She's out of the screening room, but then Dante pounces like a pack animal and she's already sent into panic mode again. She holds her hands over her ears and cowers in the back.
||pulsatilla||"Unfortunately."
||pulsatilla||"Don't send me your genitalia in my emails ever again, please." He says to Dante.
||yaoiprincess||Asami looks down at the floor. Men used to go to war.
||elainatime||Wh- Dante? I- We like, Just talked Xavier gives him a hug on the ground and rubs his back a little.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``As everyone files back outside...a small groan and grumble. The sound of a generator whirrs to life, within the walls, gears clanking closer, closer and closer.``

Watching the tackling, with a lazy clap. <a:CH_Clap:715599170685108336>

||elainatime||Oh! Good! Good, thank god! I was actually, like, really worried- HE IS TACKLED

||pulsatilla||Yuumi's gaze shifts to Xavier. "Oh, it's you. I appreciate your assistance from earlier, kind stranger. I found my daughter." <a:SPARKLE:1062177352983003177> 

He still doesn't smile, though.
||elainatime||Xavier is here.
||starzono||He is here now!! Surprise time!!! So exciting 
||yaoiprincess||Present. Asami is going to sandwich Callista between her and Yuumi now.
||pulsatilla||
||frooztiez||Heremts
||helminthic||Here............................................
||bellboy||*through*
||snombi||<a:walkin:1058575685431603372>
||frooztiez||She is dragged!
||helminthic||OFF
||frooztiez||Theri nods slightly, not out of a social fear but a genuine acknowledgement (RARE). Chocolate cake... mghmhmmhhhmhghm... it stops her ever expanding patheticness for a second, just to think about it. "that....that would... be nice....."

A very shaky sleeve is extended, resting limply in Uno's palm. Her hand is like halfway up her shirt she hates touching people.
||yaoiprincess||Through!
||helminthic||Ah, so he was towering over her and he has a dark enigmatic look in his eyes. "Food sounds good, huh? I haven't eaten a thing today... I really want some chocolate cake," he says. But as soon as his oppurtunity to get some arose, they were called. 

He tilts his head and offers his hand. "Let's go together, shall we?"
||elainatime||Xavier goes to the Screening room.
||frooztiez||She is 4'11! he towers over her she wants to cry

The leaning away helps somewhat, however being pat on the head only causes her to flinch slightly, retracting further into her 'shell' of a jacket. It's not like she thinks that he'll harm her, it's just that... what if he does? She can't shake the possibilities, and by golly gosh it scares her so!

"...g.f..--food........" "...imm... trying .. to find.... something to- to eat....." Halfway through her sentence she pauses, mulling over her thoughts, and then continues on but *much* slower. She THINK of her word she THINK
||helminthic||And was she small! (I actually have no idea how small or tall she is. Uno is 6'0 for ref....) Uno unfortunately was not being very socially acceptable right now-- he is typically more friendly than this-- something about how nervous she seemed to be, perhaps. He cracks his knuckles and looks her up and down before...

he leans away and pats her on the head. "Please do not fret. I am not here to harm you. 

....Where are you off to?"
||frooztiez||In her Fortnite Drip  , Theri couldn't look smaller when being stared dwon by Uno. She *hates* when people stare at her, entirely unsure of what she should do now, deciding to fumble around with her hands for some form of solace.

"..........h................hnnnooo???" wwHHYY LEAN it hurts her brain... She shrinks back a little bit, refusing to make eye contact as she finds a very nice part of the floor to stare at.
||helminthic||As soon as he hears someone approach, he turns very slowly-- giving them a long hard stare before approaching. It felt like more of an accost than anything with the purpose he put into his movement. "Hello."

Uno continues with his unsettling INTP stare for a moment before leaning toward the girl in front of him. "Are you headed somewhere worth exploring?"
||frooztiez||She is here! And pausing as sson as she sees that someone is just standing in the middle of the hall. She hasn't... ate anything, her main reason for finally leaving her room, and now she must face her biggest challenge: someone just standing around.

Unsure if approaching is a good idea, she just stands there in the hallway, vibrating slightly with unease.
||helminthic||Uno has not done much exploring of this place which was extremely unlike him... Perhaps he was unmotivated because he was really depressed about the waffle from this morning. But he had the rest of his time here to investigate...

For now he's just... Staring at the carpet???
||aias_||"Hm. Akitwo, you alright with me eating in your room? I would ideally like to grab a plate on my way up."
||aias_||"*47?* Color me impressed."
Baeyo has her fingers covering her mouth, suppressing the desire to giggle at just...*them.*
||aias_||"Oh my."
||aias_||"What's the 4th meal?"
||aias_||"I'm doing quite fine actually. A bit hungry if anything. Skipped breakfast."
She puts her hand on her hips and smiles towards the big guy.

"So, you must be Dante. I've heard a bit about you from Yuumi. You're taller than I thought you'd be."

She kicks the janitor door closed and gives Akiko a knowing look before glancing at the two of them.

||aias_||"Pfft....Well, well, well, throwing gay people back into the closet--I'll need to talk to upper management about this one."
Baeyo lightly kicks open the janitor closet door with her foot.

Stare
"....Hi Akitwo. You seem busy." She looks incredibly amused.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> Youre left in the janitors closet. You cant go back in the way you came.
||elainatime||Oh, shit. No, you think they took it? Xavier looks confused. Like, who? Like, the . Um. Trombones?
||elainatime||Dante, do you have your phone on you?
||elainatime||Oh, no way. Xavier turns to Dante.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Yuling, when you check your pocket, you feel its right-
Wait. Wait a minute. 
Check the other one- wait. Oh wait silly u just put it in the

Its not THERE AT ALL???
||elainatime||Oh! Oh I would so love to, check me out on Soundcloud, @Gravier  Xavier gives a big ol proud smile. I could show you myself but I couldnt figure out how to get on google. Maybe if you have your phone? I lost mine.
||elainatime||Bro! You should have heard the last piece I was playing! It was such a banger, it went like  Xavier tries to recreate the song with his voice. He does air guitar along with it. It sounds complicated and bad. You cant tell what song it was.
||elainatime||Oh, if you like classical music, just wait til I get my guitar, man. Ill play you some classical guitar. Xavier is so earnest! He is practically sparkling with eagerness.
||elainatime||Thanks Dante. Xavier brightens, like 10x. Man, whenever we get out of here, youre coming to the studio with me. Were gonna poob out together. Make some bangers. Its gonna go goofy.
||elainatime||9

The bars are kind of lackluster. definitely nowhere as good as they were earlier. Xavier seems disappointed in himself.
Sorry. Im usually a lot better at that.  Im just, like. You know. Not the best day for me. 

That beat was sick though, Dante. Youre really good at that.
||elainatime||i roll for performance
||elainatime||iforgottoping <@324775830536323073>
||elainatime||Xavier laughs. I - No, I dont really sing. But if you beatbox, Ill lay some bars on top of it.
||elainatime||Music-wise, I draw a lot of my inspiration from a lot of different folks. I was trained from a young age, classical guitar, south american influence. Some of my favorite artists are Hermeto Pascoal, Sergio Assad, and Jose Escobar. I actually studied under Assad for a bit, he composed a piece for me. If your character is familiar with Latin classical guitar, they might also be familiar with the renowned Venezuelan guitarist Pablo Valdez. But I like to produce more electronic music. Im very inspired by tame impala, vince staples, Jai Paul, Underscores, Kendrick, Brockhampton. Xavier pauses, then smiles sheepishly. I should probably stop there. Do you have a favorite artist?
||elainatime||youdontneedtotalktothebellhop! I already. Talked to him. He doesnt. Uhm. Know anything about the guitar? Xavier is EAGER to change the subject to music!!! you dont know the can of worms that youre opening.
||elainatime||Oh, that might be cool. I would want to make sure everything was like, super clean though. You know, like, sterile? Xavier blinks. Um. I asked the. Bellhop.
||elainatime||Thats super cool. Can you, like, tell me what my blood type is?
||elainatime||//IF ANYONE WANTS TO HEAR XAVIERS MUSIC I WILL SEND IT TO YOU!!!!!! REAL MUSIC MADE BY XAVIER!!!!!!!!!
||elainatime||Blood, huh? What do you, um, test for?
||elainatime||Yeah! Guitar. Classically trained. But I also produce. Music. Xavier adds music on at the end, a clarification.
||elainatime||Are you a  doctor? Yuling?
||elainatime||Xavier daps Yuling up. Yuling - thats right. Im Xavier. Nice to meet you.
||elainatime||im sorry, im actually so stupid. Im just, like. Augh. He smacks his head, then presses two fingers against his eyebrow. Um. Im like, so sorry. I have actually no braincells. Can you please remind me what your name was? I know, Im so sorry to ask you again.
||elainatime||it would be more like
||elainatime||wait xavier would do more
||elainatime||Im Xavier  Im sorry, what did you say your name was again?
||elainatime||Xavier chuckles. Wabadoo. He fist bumps Dante.
||elainatime||Xavier thinks for a second. Well - how about this - if I need a break from you, I can just like, tell you. And then youll know. Xavier takes another breath. And then you can also know when I dont need a break from you. Because those are the times when I dont tell you that I need a break from you. Like right now.
||elainatime||What? No! No, its not like that. Xavier puts a hand on Dantes shoulder. Its just  a little loud sometimes. Its not you. I dont need a break from Dante.
||elainatime||What do you - mean?
||elainatime||Wait.
||elainatime||Yeah.  What?
||elainatime||No, Im. Its okay. I know you had good intentions, man. Xavier takes a deep breath. Im sorry for. Um. Running from you. I wasnt really - running from. You, I was just. I needed to get. Xavier looks around. Out Of. There
||elainatime||And seriously, Im not pregnant. Like, actually. I cant even. Like. I dont have the right equipment for that.
||elainatime||Xavier slips out of the storage closet. Please, just like, dont Yell, man. He huffs. Its seriously, like, just. Overstimulating.
||elainatime||STILL??? 
||elainatime||Dante Xavier calls out, Dude, Ill come out if you promise youll be chill.
||elainatime||i think this counts
||elainatime||15. Xavier is hiding in the storage closet
||elainatime||how do i roll for hiding
||elainatime||Oh god . Xavier is hiding so hard right now.
||elainatime||HE IS HIDING FROM DANTE
||elainatime||XAVIER IS HERE! HE RUNS IN
||aias_||The only thing going to be broken is the distance between them 
||aias_||She's definitely following. She's still a bit miffed that she doesn't know what to address him as but her face doesn't show it.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||"Excellent, glad we're in agreement here," he drums a little on Junzo's shoulders. 

"Citrus? I'll be the caboose...cabooso (kabooso)" He laughs a little at his own joke. 

He waits for Citrus to go, then looking at Baeyo to follow. 

<@555990109355507712> <@248897197935034378> <@242165436731359232>
||bellboy||*Citrus smiles smugly at Junzo's compliance. It's entertaining to him.* " Yes. We can talk it out in the break room. "
||bellboy||*Citrus....raises a brow.*
||aias_||Baeyo looks pretty shocked. This isn't typically what diffuses tense workplace talks from the higher ups. Junzo, to her surprise, seems to have a way with words.

"Thank you, Kazuo. I appreciate the accommodation. I won't disappoint."

She let's out a sigh of relief and allows herself the luxury of loosening up.

"And Kazuo, may I know your full name? I'd prefer to address you properly if we're to be working together for the near future. I never got a proper introduction."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> <@555990109355507712> <@242165436731359232>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo leans in and gives Junzo a bro hug.

"Now that's a fair point," he does a little shoulder pat. "And you know, I'm glad you called me out on that, I actually like being held accountable." He leans out and puts both of his hands on the shoulders, firm like a hand shake. "Actually, that's what I was gonna do, right after people were done with brunch, and getting you know, to know eachother more that we have teams established, right?" 

He looks over to Citrus and smiles, like Citrus was gonna agree with him. 

"Now, I still do need to give you guys a consequnce, and this isn't gonna be anything on record, or anything, we can just talk it out in the break room, does that sound good?"
||aias_||"Ahah..." She quietly does a hesitant, nervous laugh under her breath.
She's just standing in apprehension waiting for their sentence to be dished out. Her plan to save Jinzo effectively binned for the moment.
||bellboy||*Citrus....lowers his foot.*
||aias_||"No, sir."
She stands straight.
"I understand why this was a problem. It won't happen again. I'm sorry our first proper meeting is here, Kazuo."

She's going a bit insane because she can't address him by his last name.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo doesn't seem to be very upset, but he draws his breath slowly, stepping in front of where Junzo is going to move. " Let me translate," He waves off Citrus's intesnity for just a moment. "See, I really thought better of you both, and I appreciate the apology. I do. But things do have consequences," he clicks his tongue. "Look, you guys could've gotten yourselves hurt or broken something- and am I wrong for saying that?" He asks, very stern. 

<@248897197935034378> <@555990109355507712>
||aias_||Baeyo stands up and is about to open her mouth when Junzo begins to speak ahead of her. She just kind of  with her prepared response. She tries her best to put on a pleasant smile and she bows her head slightly.
"Hm. Ah... I'd...like to apologize for any trouble this may have caused. I merely was curious whether this gate was even possible to be lifted. I understand this conflicts with whatever rules are in place, and I am willing to accept any punishment. I ask however, that Junzo at least be spared from any consequences. I was the one who asked him to assist me. The fault lies with me."

She flicks her eyes towards Junzo and tries to give the two Trumpets a sympathetic look (not that her face is visible much), as if to say "I'm sorry about him."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@555990109355507712> u can have a serious reply
||maamthatsafederaloffense||((Ur all goood, I need to grab my grocery DoorDash

Edit: Waluigi got a bonus star in first its so over
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Kazuo takes Citruss hand in his and kisses it gently.
||bellboy||*Citrus holds a hand to Kazuo's face whilst still staring at facing Junzo and Baeyo. His hand waits for what it demands while giving the Junzo and Baeyo a glare of cold annoyance.* " You brainless idiots. Do none of you have the decency to ask any questions at all ? Ask where that may lead to or if it would open ? No. You're instead impatient without the intelligence of a rotting almond. Neither of you have permission to open that gate and will suffer the consequence of breaking rules."

*He reaches over to grab his left foot, waiting for kazuo's okay.*
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Aspennot even gonna watch crazy
||maamthatsafederaloffense||After the commmotion you look ahead of you, you find Kazuo, standing there, and to his right Citrus. 

They look like theyve been watching for sometime. Kazuo pulls out a garage door like button, and the alarm stops buzzing. 

<@242165436731359232>
||aias_||She leans back on her hands and sighs. Her smile has receded into a thin line.
"You've done more than enough, Jinzo. I'm sorry. I'll take full responsibility if we're given grief over this for whatever reason."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Baeyo, a good pal, pries Junzo out, only leaving creases in his clothes.
||aias_||[Strength: 22]
Baeyo's trying to pry the gate up so Junzo can get himself outa there
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Junzo not even Mei lol
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Aias, then Junzo
||maamthatsafederaloffense||<@248897197935034378> Shes just fine- I mean shes real winded from that lifting, she was giving it her all, but perhaps she knows how to bail better, and gets away just fine. 

<@555990109355507712> Junzo he needs to work on his form. Junzo, inbetween the hinges, you have both your shirt and your pants, caught. Junzo, you find your right arm and right leg pinned effectively from this. And even though you may not care about your clothes if you pull, the tension against your body wont let you leave, not without help.

 ``ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?``
||aias_||Baeyo's too far in. She can't just drop out now. And again Junzo is hard carrying this operation

||maamthatsafederaloffense||Press on?
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``You start to hear rapid beeping, similar to an alarm system.``
||aias_||Baeyo already has her fingers curled around the bottom of the gate. Clearly she's struggling.
[Strength 7]

"I'd--I'd really appreciate...it if you could assist, Junzo."

<@&1213006530828566598> Is it possible to lift the gate in front of the mall?
||aias_||"Ah, apologies. I was a bit distracted when looking through the registry sheet."

She hums to herself as she turns away from Junzo and strides over towards the door.

"Thank you for the assistance, Junzo. I appreciate you going out of your way for me. I'll let you go if it's locked though."

She beacons him over in the same gesture and waves to Soraya in the same gesture.
||snombi||She's quickly walking down the hallway and went to go check out the rowdy room because, if she recalled correctly, it was open now. She also spotted Baeyo in the hall, waving politely at her before going inside.
||aias_||She takes his hand and gives a moderately firm shake before returning her hand to her side.
"Ah. #607 if I recall. Pleasure to meet you, Junzo."

She glances at his chest one more time. And then she looks to the sheet by the mall gate.

She snaps her fingers and points down the hall. "...Say, Junzo, I promise this will be quick, could you help me get that metal sheet in front of the mall up? It'll just take a second."

She glances down to the screening room. She wonders if Callista is in there.
||aias_||Baeyo is going to call out to him! It's the man of the hour! She's at least going to do her due diligence and meet formally with everyone.

"...Oh my."

Baeyo's gonna spring up and approach Junzo. She's leaning forward a little and has her hands in her pockets.

"Hello there, I don't think we've *properly* introduced. My name is Baeyo and I'll be working in admi--"

She glances down at the somewhat melted icepack strapped to his chest. Another fight, perhaps? She pauses for just a second before resuming her introduction as if she hadnt interrupted herself at all.

"--nistration. May I ask what your name is?" She grins and holds a hand out in front of her.
||aias_||Baeyo is chillin. She keeps looking down the hallway with the screening and rowdy rooms and squinting.
||aias_||Baeyo is just gonna hit him with "...Ah. Ms. Koyama. Well Mr. Akiara, I'll see you when I see you." As he scrambles out of there
||yaoiprincess||Walk
||yaoiprincess||Asami stops in her tracks and calmly walks to the screening room with a smile on her face.
||pulsatilla||`16` Sorry, Baeyo. The demon is coming and Yuumi does not want to stick around for the hellish flames she possesses. Yuumi immediately tries walking/speeding away. He pushes the wheelchair with him, nope.
||yaoiprincess||REAL
||pulsatilla||REAL?
||yaoiprincess||Asami sees Yuumi and starts running towards him really fast
||pulsatilla||Stare. "Sheeple." Peepaw. Bye Theri!!!
||frooztiez||she makes direct eye contact with yuumi and looks miserable. Hi Yuumi!!!
||pulsatilla||Stare.
||bellboy||*thrroouugh w theri !*
||pulsatilla||Stare. <-- his version of waving to people who pass him.
||bellboy||*stevie through*
||pulsatilla||"Indeed. While many might dwell in despair, I have a deep respect for those who can discover moments of happiness in seemingly bleak circumstances." He adjusts his glasses thoughtfully.

"...Indeed I'm uncertain of his intended meaning. Was it a reference to violence, desire, or perhaps a combination of both?" What exactly does 'blowing brains out' entail...
||aias_||She cocks *her* head to the side. She's trying to figure out exactly what context he's using the phrase 'enjoying yourself' but she concludes that he doesn't seem the type for euphemisms.

"Yeah? What of it? I'm going to try to find happiness no matter where I am. Not going to just sit here feeling miserable."

Baeyo snorts and starts giggling after hearing Yuumi's Dante explanation. Less so at Dante's antics themselves but more so at the mention of Junzo. "Hehe... I'm assuming you're referring to the "blowing her brains out" guy? They called him Junzo right? Personally I found him to be quite amusing, really. Xavier too. I enjoy watching them."
||pulsatilla||"You'll be 'enjoying' yourself while you're also on the job?" He tilts his head to the side. He wonders how one can enjoy themselves here, of all places.

At the question, Yuumi rests his eyes shut, huffing. "So, now you're inquisitive about the Big Guy. Dante, He/Him. He is very physical, loud, and vulgar. Much like that other man from the meeting, though I don't know if he could be considered physical." Junzo...
||aias_||"...Agreed. Personally not too excited about my prospects of leaving. Figured I might as well enjoy myself to the best of my ability while I'm here."

Baeyo glances over to her wheelchair bound coworker.
"....If you don't mind me asking, what was happening between you and that other guy before I arrived--I think his name was Datice or something? Dave? Name started with a D for sure."
||pulsatilla||"It is unfortunate, isn't it. I don't expect us getting out anytime soon." He shrugs, blunt and realistic.
||aias_||She pauses.
"My bad. But it was mostly...nerves, really. I spent a while looking to escape when I had woken up... But when they started listing out our roles it really began to set in that they really weren't going to let us leave."

Baeyo grimaces and tries to avert her gaze. (Again, her eyes aren't even visible so what's she even doing?) "...But, personally I'd rather not linger on my panic attacks if I could avoid it."
||pulsatilla||"Akiara." He corrects.

"I'm as well as I can be." 

"What were you stressed over?" Curious.
||aias_||She clicks her tongue. "Ah. Hm. I'm doing alright. The stress was just getting to me. Just needed to find something else to focus on." 

She goes to squat next to his wheel chair. "What about you, Mr. Kiara? How have you been faring?"
||pulsatilla||They glance over at Baeyo. "I see you're feeling better. Did you manage to shake off that panic attack?" He hums, blank looking.
||aias_||"Ah. Well then, it was nice meeting you Aspen. I'd love to talk again soon!" She grins and waves him off.
||pulsatilla||Yuumi nods to him as he leaves. "Bye."
||aias_||GN!
||pulsatilla||<a:SCcorn:688028506252115999> GOODNIGHT ELIAS))
||aias_||//also will be on, just a bit less frequent, watching a show with my roomie
||aias_||"Oh? Have you known him for a while? I was actually hoping to meet with him soon. Just had a few questions about well...the administration, funnily enough."

"Aspen, I hope you do alright with the financial work. Feel free to find me if you have any questions. I work as an accountant at Goldman Sachs, so stuff like this is my strong suit." wink! (he can't see it tho)
||pulsatilla||"We will not be working close." He states, finally tearing his eyes away to look at Aspen.

"I figure we will be handling the difficult work, as we work directly underneath the chairman."
||aias_||"Indeed. Mr. Akiara and I will be working *very* close from now on." She looks up and presses her index finger against her lips, "Hmm...That said, I'm not quite sure what administration duties we'll be handling seeing as their data seemingly involves managing games."

Shrug. "I'm sure it'll all work out though."
||aias_||"Pfft. Eye see you, eye see you." She doesn't look phased by this at all and gently retracts her hand. Still smiling.
||pulsatilla||He leans back, creating a bit of distance. He doesn't shake her hand. "As expected." To... what?

"No." He answers, but doesn't stop staring. Hm.
||aias_||"Ah, of course Aspen. Analytics and financing right? I was kind of hoping I'd get thrown into that one myself. My skillset is a *bit* more tailored to that than administration."

She turns and bends her knees to get closer to the now sitting Yuumi. She holds out her hand to him as well. "--That's not to say I'm not excited to work with you Mr. Akiara. I hope we get along~"

She blinks a bit in surprise seeing Yuumi's extended stare. (Not that anyone else can see it past her hair) "Aha...is there um...something on my face?"
||pulsatilla||Yuumi looks between the two. "Aspen." He nods, remembering the name. He mutters the same for Baeyo.

He has a wheelchair next to him, so he takes a seat to it while leaning on the cane. He can't help but stare... at his- 'teammate'. Hm.
||aias_||Baeyo smiles broadly. She tilts her head to the side as she hums to herself.

"Oh, not at all! My name is Baeyo Lafitte. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Desjardins." She extends her hand towards Aspen. "...You were assigned to Citrus's group, correct?"
||pulsatilla||He doesn't get the chance to reply, as Baeyo makes her entrance. He doesn't seem annoyed, if anything, it saves him the time.

"Yuumi Akiara." He nods his head, slow blinking. "Nothing was interrupted."
||aias_||Baeyo struts by with her hands in her pockets. With her usual swagger. She had intended to check out what the rowdy room was actually like when...

She sees her new coworker!
She pauses and completely pivots over to the two.

"Ah. Hello Yuumi. How are y-" She cuts herself short and covers her mouth, in semi mock surprise. She glances over towards Aspen. "Oh, apologies, sorry for the intrusion. Am I interrupting something?"
||pulsatilla||I should describe his fit real quick.

Yuumi is clad in a long, tattered sweater with frayed ends. The sweater is a dark grey hue with thick weaving, adorned with white stripe designs. Beneath it, his bare chest is exposed, revealing a canvas of faded burn scars that snake their way up his neck, nearly covering every inch of his skin. He pairs the sweater with oversized white pants cinched with a belt, and tops off his ensemble with a hat featuring a black see-through veil. Completing his look, he wears tinted shades. + His trusty cane and bag!

"No." Wow... Roleplay...
||pulsatilla||Uncomfortably long stare.

"Hello."
||pulsatilla||Yuumi stares at him as he walks.
||pulsatilla||He parks himself here. No people around, hm.

||starzono||He would flash a smile back, before following!
||aias_||She turns her head to face the two of them, flashes a smile, and walks over in the lobby.
||starzono||"A lovely idea! I am fine with coming along!"
He's already good to check out the shennanigans that might have ensued in the lobby. He is incredibly curious. And slightly concerned.
||aias_||"Mm. Well I was going to propose we look into the computers. I was a bit too occupied to start it myself. Whoever's keeping us here must be *real* confident to give each of us a phone and a computer. "

She crosses her arms and sighs.

"*But* it's on the way to the elevator. I don't mind seeing what the everybody else is doing. Come, you two."
||snombi||She shook her head. "..No such luck. I'm sorry.."

And on the subject of checking, she already heard the beginnings of her mind screaming at her.

"It's a.. a little.. loud. Over there, but.. um.. if you wa.. want to, I.. I won't stop you.."
||starzono||He couldn't help but glance over as well.
"...Should, we check and see what is going on over there?"
||aias_||"... Someone's making a woman cry...?"
She's glancing over further into the lobby. She's beginning to look just a bit concerned.
||aias_||Baeyo nods. She can't quite fault him for that because she almost didn't exit her own.

"And Ms.Hasegawa? Did you find anything on yours?"
||starzono||"Oh! I tried doing something with it for a moment, but nothing came of it so I moved on. Admittedly, I spent more time just trying to figure out how to get out of the room than searching about for anything."
His priorities are a jumbled mess at times, that much is certain.
||aias_||Baeyo hears a bunch of dudes screaming for women up in another part of the lobby.

*Pity. The cries of the desperate.*
(If she was up to date on current slang she'd call them gooners.)

"I'd rather not know what they're screaming about women for. But c'mon. Ms.Hasegawa. Mr. Chaput. We have *much* more productive things we could be doing."

She smiles as she puts a hand on each of their shoulders.

"Tell me, have either of you checked out the computers in your rooms?"
||starzono||"Oh, definitely a scary thought. I think listening in on mall conversations would be quite the annoyance--"
He paused. Oh my.
"I wonder what that nonsense is about!"
||snombi||She heard.. screaming? About.. women? Huh? Wait a minute. She was a woman- WERE THEY GOING TO COME FOR HER? DEAR GOD. "Eeehhhh.." <:btw_stare:1071586838319476847>
||aias_||"A prison? Hm. Thats a scary thought. I couldn't imagine just being forced to isolate in a room like that."

She glances right down the hall to where the mall would be if not for the sheet. And raises an eyebrow. (Not that anyone could notice it.)

"... Being confined and forced to listen to the footsteps and conversations of the local mall goers does seem exceptionally cruel I think."
||starzono||"In front of a parking lot?? Now, you could have just mentioned that from the start before I started coming up with silly theories!"
He let out an overly-exasperated sigh, purposefully being dramatic to be amusing.
"That is a great point. Still curious about what a rowdy room is. Could it be where they put people who are rowdy??? Like a prison??"
||aias_||"Windon't know what you're talking about, Chaput!"

Baeyo playfully lifts her finger and snickers.

"Ah... But anyway, I'd doubt they'd have windows on the interior anyway. We're currently located in front of a parking lot. Something tells me that they wouldn't want the screening room or whatever the hell a rowdy room is to be viewable from the outside."
||starzono||"...What? There could be windows *inside* of the rooms that lead to the outside. Think outside the box. Or, inside it?"
He knows what he is trying to convey but knows not how to convey it to the others. Hm.
"So, say this room. It has no windows. That room--"
He points to the door.
"--Could have windows. Yes?"
||aias_||Baeyo looks at the clearly windowless rooms. Her smile seems to slip for just a second. She's not dignifying his suggestion with a response.
||snombi||<:btw_stare:1071586838319476847> She started pacing around the hallway. Eeee.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Nope!
||aias_||"Mhm. Well I--"
<@&1213006530828566598> 
None of these rooms have viewable windows, do they?
||starzono||"Unfortunate indeed... Perhaps there is a way to get them open? There could be some window in them that may be unlocked. Possibly! That is the hope."
||snombi||"..Ah. Unfortunate.."
||snombi||<:hamnyoron:915076765314076692>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Same jiggle jiggle principle
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Bwomp.  <:buh:1117548672012525629> <:WWWAAAHHRR:1170148124220735529> also locked
||snombi||He was spitting bars.. She's going to go see if the screening room would open up too. <@&1213006530828566598>
||starzono||"Oh, yes! Checking out rooms should be very do-able, I am curious what that could be too! Non-sensical business decisions? Monkey-ing around? I haven't a clue! Unfortunate that it seems locked at the moment, let us test the other door too!"
With that, he'd go and try to open the screening room door.
||snombi||boo womp.
||aias_||"Ah-- So it seems our captors aren't quite ready for us to get *rowdy*. I expect the screening door to be locked as well. There's no harm in trying though."
||maamthatsafederaloffense||Unfortunately, the door is locked. It does jiggle, so I mean it can be unlocked at some point
||snombi||Alright, she was glad someone that wasn't her made a decision. She followed Baeyo, head hung slightly low.
||aias_||"That's fine by me! I'm *more* than curious what one does in a "rowdy room" anyway."

Baeyo hums to herself as she begins making her way to the rowdy door to the rowdy room.
||snombi||With time, Soraya was back up on her feet. She gave her hair a light tug, as if to get herself back together. "Did we.. ah.. want to, um.. check out any of.. of these rooms here? I.. I almost forgot about it.."
||aias_||Baeyo is *also* doing jazz hands as she watches the two of them converse.
||starzono||He loves seeing people try to mimic his little gestures, it always makes him happy to see others play along! A little bit of sunshine, as one may say.
"Not a problem at all, mademoiselle!! I would do anything to bring a smile to other people's faces whenever I can~"
||snombi||Was it really wonderful or was he just saying that to make her feel better? ..Hmm. Maybe she was that great. Haha. Yes.. maybe. 

"..Th..Thank you for.. trying to.. help, Mr. Chaput.."
||starzono||"Yes!! Wonderful!! Just like that!! I enjoy jazz hands. They help!! I almost always carry a lot of things with me to improve a situation. Like glitter!! I do not have any at the moment. Stuffy office outfits do not come with glitter."
||snombi||She slowly removed her hands from her face while Valmont was doing his silly jazz hands. She tried to do the same with her own, but she felt that she wasn't giving enough energy, and thus stopped.

"Eeehhhh.." <:melting:771845244198322256>
||starzono||"Yes, exactly!! Right now, we are fine, and that is what matters the most."
He doesn't have much more to say about that, simply giving jazz hands instead. Jazz hands always improves a situation.
||snombi||..Oh, that.. made sense. No immediate threat has been seen, from what she knew. The room she woke up in was scary enough, considering how much surveillance was in there. But, as far as she knew, nothing was harming her, at least not yet anyway.

"..I. um.. I.. sup.. suppose.. so.." She took a deep breath to try and calm herself down, like he suggested.
||starzono||Oh, do not fear, it will be okay! We likely are not as risk of being killed, either! Everything will be fine. And Perfect attendance? I am sure that this circumstance is a very reasonable reason to be absent. If it were to take a negative impact, I am sure things can be negotiated! Take a deep breath, we will surely be alright!
He had a bright smile on his face, trying to help out where he could.
||snombi||She instinctively started to hide her face with her hands again, as if that would prevent anyone from seeing here. She stood out like a sore thumb with her purple hair and everything.

"*Mnnnnhh*, I.. I'm not even.. even a good h..hhostage.. Maybe I g..guh.. got caught because.. because I was so.. so easyyy.. And then.. and then they're g..guh.. gonna kill mm.. meee.. and.. and.. AND-" She was spiraling, as it were. "*Hhhhnnhhh...* I n..need to.. go homeee.. I'm.. I'm going to.. to miss work and then I'm going to get fired and my perfect attendance is going to get ruined AND AND AND-"

Soraya was speaking extremely quickly, giving herself no time to even breathe. When she does stop, she's pale in the face and she feels lightheaded again.
||starzono||Well, searching cannot do any harm, yes? It could prove to be worthwhile, especially if we find a means to escape!
His attention was turned back to Soraya as she slid down a wall to cry, and hed step over to her.
Well, I am sure we will be okay! After all, there is a lot of us, we can likely find some sort of flaw here!
||snombi||While all that was going on, Soraya had already gone into panic mode several times over, and Baeyo's comments about being hostages and victims only made it worse. She separated herself again and pressed her back to a wall, slowly sliding down it and grabbing a hold on her head. It doesn't take her too long to start crying, unfortunately.
||aias_||Baeyo shrugs.
"Eh. I doubt we'll need to do much more searching. In cases like these, the captor usually has it's victims here because they need something from us. We're bound to be informed of what they ask of us soon enough. Well, that or we're going to be used as hostages to extort money from our families."

"Pfft. Jokes on them..."
||starzono||Oh No, no, I meant I have not been kidnapped *before now*, I made a grave error in my speech with that!
He looked back to Akiko with a shrug.
Hm. I have no clue! I did a flip in front of the camera and it made no sound. No noise. It was odd! Im not sure if it is on a timer or not, because if so, I would assume it would take pictures at set intervals, but it only went of twice when I was at the door. It is confusing
He ended up shaking his head.
I will be getting back to the investigating a bit now, we can talk more later after gathering more clues and such!
Hed give a bow, spinning a little, and then getting back to it!
||aias_||`I have not been kidnapped before.`

Baeyo is sideyeing him so hard right now. Ultimately she thinks his dimeaner is more amusing than irritating so she decides to tone down her response.

"*Mr. Chaput*, do you mean to tell me that you *didn't* wake up in a bed that wasn't yours, in a building you don't know anything about, with no idea why you're here or how you arrived?"

It wasn't toned down as much as she thought she did.
||starzono||Ah, not to worry! I was simply teasing to begin with~ Though, I have heard a lot of people are doctors! And an accountant! Are there famous accountants? That seems like a rather mundane job to me!
He paused for a moment.
Wait, did you say better kidnappers? That is quite wild! I have not been kidnapped before. That seems awful.
||aias_||Baeyo turns to face Valmont and Soraya.

"Ah. Sorry Valmont. It's less a secret and more an observation. Tell me, can you see anything hidden in this room?"
||starzono||"Aha, very correct, I am a magician!! Nothing that can help too much in investigating, I am afraid! But, I will do what I can to assist you all!"
He beamed towards Akiko, before watching as Baeyo whispered once again.
"Now, I am unsure on how well investigations are going to go if secrets keep being shared~"
||aias_||`...`
||aias_||Baeyo affectionately flicks Akiko lightly on the forehead.

"I'm so glad to see you again. Sorry for the lapse in letters, I got caught up in something."

She looks around the room and squints.

"But as for my thoughts..."

She leans down again to whisper in Akiko's ear
||starzono||Haha, well, this is more tense now than he thought it was going to be. At least, it reads as tense to him. He is sort of awkwardly watching this and hoping it doesn't become anything major. I mean, as far as he knows, yeah, everyone's maybe been kidnapped and can't get out. Fighting? Not too preferable in the moment. Maybe this is just being silly too, who knows!!!!!
"Haha, yes, anyways!!! I am *incredibly* famous--"
He isn't. No one would know who he is. He is an amateur stage magician at best.
"--So that could be it?? I do not know. Possibly?"
||aias_||Baeyo is once again has her face drawn back in an elongated grin.

"*Tsk tsk*"

"Seems like *someone* didn't check the sheet."

Baeyo's kind of astounded at how few people decided to check around their rooms upon waking up in someone else's bed.

She's totally lost interest in the mall or the exit. She's making her way straight towards Akiko. She puts a hand on her shoulder, and a shining yellow eye trains itself on Akiko's face from behind the large blanket of hair that hides Baeyo's face.

"C'mon, *Akitwo* don't make me say it."

She leans up close to her ear and whispers something.

`...`
||starzono||He blinked a bit. Oh my. There is tension in the room. Or, friendship? More than friendship?? So many possibilities.
"You two know each other?? How nice!! I haven't seen anyone I know here! I do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing. Oh well. Time will tell."
"In any case, no, I actually feel far too stuffy and posh and it reminds me of my brother-in-law and it is not too pleasant!!"
||aias_||Baeyo's smile fades into a straight line. She sucks in air through clenched teeth and turns towards the person she least expected to be here.

She tilts her head over her shoulder to look back at the red headed woman.

"...Ah... I was *really* hoping you wouldn't be here when I saw your name on the registry document. I assumed you'd be off in Japan or something."

"How long's it been since we talked last? What like, 19...20 years? It's nice to finally see you again, Akiko."
||starzono||"Very true!! Surely there must be something of the sort, then. Maybe it will be open later! How exciting! I hope that with those clothes we would be fine to leave our rooms. Speaking of-- Is that not odd? I would not wear this attire for any sort of work. Never. Why was that a requirement?"
||aias_||"I wouldn't doubt it. What is a night mall if not an expanded night market?"
||starzono||"Ah. Then likely not closed at these hours. I have made a mistake in that suggestion! Unless it is a night mall. Do those exist?"
||aias_||"Pfft. Right."
"It looks a like it's a little before noon. Maybe 11?" She shrugs.
||starzono||He just.
"Haha!! I did not look at much."
||snombi||. . . She needs to be shot. Now. 

".. .."
||aias_||"I'm assuming you both had the chance to look out the window in your room, correct?"
||starzono||"That is a fantastic question!! Let us see--"
He would check his wrist--
.
"...I do not even wear a watch with my normal attire. I should not have checked."
||snombi||"What time is it anyway..?" Good question...
||starzono||"Oh, hm, yes... Although, maybe it is just closed at this time! Not all malls are open all hours of the day! Or, perhaps there is construction?"
||maamthatsafederaloffense||[again, the sign points to a metal sheet for now, just to be sure]
||snombi||"Aside.. from uh.. us, obviously.."
||snombi||<:hamnyoron:915076765314076692> "..It feels a.. a little.. um.. deserted, doesn't it..?"
||aias_||It looks like Baeyo raises an eyebrow at the fact that Valmont hadn't in fact read through it diligently. But with so much hair in front of her face, who can tell? 

"So no staff? You'd think a place with a mall would have shoppers at the very least."
||snombi||"..I, um.. tried.. calling my.. h..home phone number on the.. the.. ah.. rotary phone.. For some.. reason I got.. connected to.. um.. Doctor.. Dante." 

She followed Baeyo's look towards the screening room. Hmm..
||starzono||Don't worry Soraya, he didn't read it either. He embraces that fact, though.
||starzono||"Hm? What do you mean? Are you referring to the directory? I barely skimmed through it, I did call room service, though! Although, that call was cut short by a noise coming from my door. I think it was smacked. I am quite unsure of that, though! But, so far, everything seems fine to me!"
||snombi||*ohnoshedidntreadthat*

"..I cannot recall." She mutters, already ashamed of her ineffectiveness. She thinks she should blow up.
||aias_||"..."

"Hm. A bit off topic but have any of you seen anyone *not* listed on the document in our rooms?"

She's eyeing the screening room entrance.
||maamthatsafederaloffense||``the white metal sheet extending to the mall is closed.``
||snombi||"..Oh.. ah-" She was surprised there was more to the lobby floor. Then again, a part of her was expecting to find a pool somewhere, not a "screening room", a "rowdy room", or a mall for that matter.

"..What the.."
||starzono||Here they are!
"Alright! Let us see here-- There are so many doors in this area, isn't there?"
||snombi||<:thingy:1036764144390656121>
||maamthatsafederaloffense||

The carpet of the lobby transitions into the south exit, a small hallway, with some art, that means something, but theres nothing written there to tell you what. There is a storage closet for sure, but to the immediate right is a room with a plaque titled screening room, and other conference places like a meeting room and the famed rowdy room have similar plaques too. Down the hall is a sign that points to Mall, with a white metal sheet that can move up and down.
